Quizzes are a simple and effective marketing tool for both generating leads and engaging your existing customers.

They’re so effective because they’re easy and fun to fill out, offer a reward (in the form of results), and cost you very little in the way of resources or time.

Asides from being a cheap method of engaging prospective customers, they also offer a way of gaining insight on prospects to allow for lead segmentation in future campaigns.

Why quizzes generate leads
--------------------------

Quizzes are so successful as lead generation tools because they offer personalized results and naturally encourage sharing. But, let’s dig into why these factors mean that quizzes generate leads and how that’d good for you.

**Personalized results:**

Quizzes capitalize on a lead’s desire to discover or confirm something about themselves, which is to say they appeal to a curiosity in your audience.

**Shareability:**

The quiz format naturally encourages leads to share their results, which increases exposure for your quiz and generates more leads.

The best thing about using quizzes for lead generation is that you can create them for any audience. Your topic can be chosen based on industry, sector, role, interests or something more generic (like a personality quiz).

As long as your topic/ title entices leads by targetting that curiosity, you’re bound to see some good results. For example:

* What type of marketer are you?
* What is your personality type?
* Should you hire a GDPR consultant?
* Any employee should know these 5 things about their job
* Could you pass the 6th grade?
* What body shape are you?

How to create a lead capture quiz
---------------------------------

Shout’s [Quiz Builder](https://shout.com/quiz-builder/) is the perfect tool for building lead generation quizzes. Using the drag and drop builder to add questions, a pre\-built form for capturing leads and robust features for showing scores and writing personalized results, creating quizzes couldn’t be easier.

Just follow these steps and you’ll be good to go in no time:

1. Tailor your quiz to your audience
2. Add a lead form
3. Create personalized results
4. Follow up with a welcome email

### 1\. Tailor your quiz to your audience

Evaluate what you know about your target audience and create a quiz that’s tailored to their interests. On top of this, frame your quiz in a way that focuses on leads’ problems or concerns. Then you can address these in the results or in a follow\-up email once you’ve collected their contact information.

Think about it as writing quiz questions to lead back to the service or product you provide and the hinting at the solution (your product or service) in quiz results.

### 2\. Add a lead capture form

For the highest conversion rate, place your lead capture form between the last question page and the results page. This will encourage leads to enter their information in return for their results.

People are reluctant to hand over personal information, so if you place the lead capture form at the start, quiz takers may leave before answering questions.

Placing the lead form at the end means that leads will have something to lose if they leave and something to gain if they fill out your form.

### 3\. Create a rewarding set of results

When creating a lead generation quiz, it can be easy to put all your energy into writing questions but fail to provide a robust set of results for quiz takers.

This can block leads from moving down the sales funnel and converting because the reward for their time and their personal details is lacklustre.

It can also be a detriment to the ‘sharability’ of your quiz, which is something you’ll be relying on to increase your brand exposure. If people don’t feel that your content is rewarding or valuable, they certainly won’t share it with their friends and colleagues.

[Word\-of\-mouth marketing](https://referralrock.com/blog/word-of-mouth-marketing/) is how content goes viral online, so it’s really important that your quiz takers want to share their results (and in turn sharing your quiz and branding) within their circle.

A successful quiz provides a detailed set of results that answer the questions leads had about themselves when they started. It should be something interesting that they would think to share with their friends and that encourages others to take your quiz for themselves to see how they differ.

### 4\. Follow up with a welcome email

Once a lead has reached this point, you’ve already engaged them and collected their contact information. But you don’t want this to feel like their last interaction with you, so you’ll want to think about how you can continue this relationship.

A welcome email is a great way to ‘warm’ leads. This is important because you don’t want them to forget about you the moment they get their quiz results, you want to foster a long\-term relationship.

Use the welcome email to share a little more about yourself (or your brand) and how you can help solve your leads’ problems. Do anything you can to build trust and provide value so that they keep coming back to you in the future.

Take a look at our article on [how to write welcome emails](https://shout.com/email-marketing/writing-a-welcome-email/) that keeps subscribers reading for more tips on improving welcome email engagement.

7 Tips for making an effective lead capture quiz
------------------------------------------------

Shout has over two decades of experience when it comes to quizzes and we’re prepared to share what we’ve learned with you. Here are 7 tips for optimizing your lead generation quiz:

1. Pick a topic based on your audience
2. Write an eye\-catching title
3. Keep the quiz short
4. Add rich media to boost visual engagement
5. Keep your lead form short (link to lead form article)
6. Test, test, test
7. Share your quiz in the right places

### 1\. Pick a topic based on your audience

For your lead capture quiz to perform well initially, it has to be tailored to your target audience. If your quiz has no bearing on their life or interests, it will fail before it begins.

You might not be intimate with your audience (yet!), but you will know at least one thing about them; a shared problem or something they enjoy. Pick a topic based on this and write your questions to prime quiz takers for what you eventually want to market to them.

### 2\. Write an eye\-catching title

It’s all well and good having to perfect topic and a solid set of questions, but if your title fails to catch the eye your quiz will be lost in the scroll.

Make a strong first impression with a snappy, captivating title that challenges people to click and start answers. Ensure you’re using personal language like “you” and “your”, it may seem simple but it’s an effective way to engage people quickly.

### 3\. Three minutes, max

You want your quiz to be short and sweet to maximize your completion rate. If your quiz is too long, you’ll likely see a lot of drop\-outs. If it’s too short, people may feel you’ve only created the quiz to collect their contact information.

The perfect balance is 5\-7 questions with around 5 clear answers to choose from for each. Because people expect results to be personalized, they’re going to spend a decent amount of time reading questions and answers to ensure they pick what’s most relevant to them.

### 4\. Add rich media to boost engagement

You want to make your lead capture quiz as engaging as possible, which means you don’t want it to get stale. Including rich media (such as images, videos and GIFs) is the best way to keep things feeling fresh.

All visual content should be the best quality it can be, nothing puts people off more than images and videos with low resolution or sizing issues.

### 5\. Keep your lead form short

The lead form itself should be short and simple to fill out. People are already going to be cautious of handing over their personal information, so tread as lightly as you can at first. The fewer number of fields you include, the higher number of leads you’ll collect.

You can always collect more of their info later on as part of an email campaign. Take a look at our article [lead form optimization](https://shout.com/landing-pages/lead-form-optimization-and-increasing-conversions/) for 9 tips for increasing conversions for a little more help.

### 6\. Test, test, test

Once you’ve finished writing questions and results, it’s absolutely essential that you [test your quiz](https://shout.com/help/article/27-how-to-preview-and-test-projects) thoroughly. Make sure all points are assigned correctly and each result corresponds to the answers needed to be chosen to achieve it.

If people feel that the result they received is in no way relevant to the answers they chose, they will not share the quiz with others. In fact, they might feel ripped off.

### 7\. Share your lead capture quiz

Now you need to get eyes on your quiz. You’ll want to share it across all your social media accounts, from Twitter to Pinterest, and encourage your quiz takers to share it themselves.

According to Buzzsumo, [quizzes are shared around 1900 times on average](https://buzzsumo.com/blog/quizzes-content-marketings-secret-weapon/). The more you encourage that sharing, the more leads you’ll generate and the more insight you gain from your audience.

Wrapping up
-----------

Hopefully, we’ve convinced you that quizzes are a simple and effective tool for lead generation. But they don’t just have to be used for capturing leads, they’re also super useful for engaging your existing audience in an interactive way or even for running competitions or contests.

Once you’ve started a lead generation campaign, you’ll need to start thinking about how to assign value to them. This process is known as [lead scoring](https://www.saleshacker.com/lead-scoring/).
