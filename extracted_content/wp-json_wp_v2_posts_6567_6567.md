            Your survey answers are as important to collecting high\-quality data as the question you write. So, we\\u2019ve provided some tips on writing answers options for survey questions, from multiple choice to Likert scales.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
            Top tips for writing survey answers\<\\/h2\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
            1\. Answers should be clear and concise\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            Ensure that respondents understand each answer option clearly.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
            E.g.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
            \\n
                                                            - Always\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                            - Very Often\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                            - Sometimes\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                            - Rarely\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                            - Never\<\\/li\>\\n\<\\/ul\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                The difference in meaning between \\u2018Sometimes\\u2019 and \\u2018Rarely\\u2019 isn\\u2019t obvious. But if you need to include words closely similar in meaning, it\\u2019s a good idea to define each.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                You can use a text box from Shouts\\u2019 [Presentational Items\<\\/a\> for this purpose.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                ### 2\. Don\\u2019t use \\u2018extreme absolutes\\u2019\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                This is a suggestion for both your question and answer text. These are words such as \\u2018All\\u2019, \\u2018Any\\u2019, \\u2018Best\\u2019, \\u2018Worst\\u2019, \\u2018Never\\u2019, \\u2018Always\\u2019 and tend to assume that respondents will fully agree or disagree with a statement.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                In truth, respondents aren\\u2019t likely to fully agree or disagree with a statement and are more responsive to specifics. \<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                E.g. \\u2018Once a Day \\u2013 Once a Month\\u2019 rather than \\u2018Never \\u2013 Always\\u2019\.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                ### 3\. Answers should be \\u2018collectively exhaustive\\u2019\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                All relevant survey answers should be made available to respondents.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                For example, when collecting data on customer expectations:\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
 **Question\<\\/b\>: \\u2018What level of care are you expecting for the duration of your stay?\\u2019\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n**
 **Scale\<\\/b\>: Excellent \| Very Good \| Good \| Fair\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n**
                                                                In this case, all expected answers have been provided. There\\u2019s no need to include the negative answer options, as no one would expect a poor level of care.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                ### 4\. Limit your answer options per question\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                Offering too many or too few answer options is bad practice. Too few answer options may be restrictive, whilst too many can be confusing.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                If you have more than four or five answer choices, your questions may be too broad. Ask yourself if they can be split into two or simplified in some way.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                ### 5\. Provide \\u2018No Opinion\\u2019 answer options (when necessary)\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                By including a \\u2018neutral\\u2019 answer option, such as \\u2018N\\/A\\u2019, \\u2018Prefer not to Answer\\u2019 or \\u2018No Opinion\\u2019, you give respondents the choice to opt\-out. If they aren\\u2019t given this choice, they have to select another answer. Which means that data isn\\u2019t accurate.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                However, you should read more about the use of [‘no opinion’ answer options\<\\/a\> to determine what effects they may have on your research.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                ### 6\. Good survey answers are \\u2018Mutually Exclusive\\u2019\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                No two answers should be so similar that respondents are unsure of which to pick.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                Below is the most common example of this issue.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
 **Poor Example\<\\/b\>:\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n**
                                                                Select Age Bracket: 18\-25, 25\-35, 35\-45, 45\-55, 55\-65\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
 **Good Example\<\\/b\>:\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n**
                                                                Select age bracket: 18\-25, 26 \-35, 36\-45, 46\-55, 56\-65\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                In the first example, respondents wouldn\\u2019t know which age bracket to pick if they were 25, 35, 45 or 55\.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                ### 7\. No more than 7 options for scaled questions\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                Try not to exceed more than 7 answer options for scaled questions, i.e. 3 positive answers, 1 neutral answer and 3 negative answers.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                Too many choices can be taxing for respondents and will lower your completion rates.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                This only really applies to Matrix question types (Likert scales). An Opinion Scale can contain up to 10 or 11 points (e.g. NPS ratings).\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                ### 8\. Use labels for rating scales\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                When creating a rating scale, always remember to label each point. Leaving these fields blank will only cause ambiguity.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                For example, if you have a Net Promoter Score question you\\u2019d be asking: \\u201cHow likely are you to recommend this product\\/service to a friend or colleague?\\u201d. Then you\\u2019d set a scale from 0\-10\.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                You must label one end \\u2018Not at all Likely\\u2019 (0\) and the other \\u2018Extremely Likely\\u2019 (10\), or you may confuse participants. And this is the last thing you want to do when asking for a review of your product or service.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                Learn more about how to measure customer loyalty and [calculate NPS\<\\/a\>.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                You should also ensure that the opposing labels are directly contrasting. I.e. if one end of the scale is \\u2018Very Good\\u2019, the other end should be \\u2018Very Poor\\u2019 and not \\u2018Poor\\u2019 or \\u2018Awful\\u2019\.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                ### 9\. Convert scales to contrasts\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                You don\\u2019t always have to do this, but if you\\u2019re using a lot of scaled questions it might be better to re\-frame some of them as contrasting statements instead.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                #### Rating scale question:\<\\/h4\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                Question: \\u2018How much do you agree with this statement: There is a good work\-life balance in my department\\u2019\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                Scale: Strongly Disagree \| Disagree \| No Opinion \| Agree \| Strongly Agree\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                #### Contrasting statement question:\<\\/h4\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                Question: \\u2018Is there a good work\-life balance in your department?\\u2019\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                A: \\u2018There is a positive work\-life balance\\u2019\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                B: \\u2018There is a negative work\-life balance\\u2019\.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                If someone constantly answering the same [question type\<\\/a\>, there likely to suffer from survey fatigue. Filling out an online survey isn\\u2019t the most exciting task and so it\\u2019s easy for respondents to lose interest or motivation.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                You want to do everything you can to keep them engaged.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                This also occurs if answers are repeatedly in the same order for scaled (or any multiple choice) questions.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                ### 10\. Switch the direction of scale options\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                Some respondents may speed through your survey, selecting survey answers that don\\u2019t reflect their opinion. With scaled questions, this usually manifests as straight lines in your survey data (i.e. always picking the same point of a scale for each question).\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                This is more likely to occur is you\\u2019re offering an incentive of some kind (prize\\/ promotion) but can be caused by [survey fatigue\<\\/a\> or disengagement.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                Unfortunately, there\\u2019s no real way of preventing respondents doing this (other than ensuring your survey is as engaging as possible). However, you can reduce the effect of this on your results by reversing the direction of scales for each question.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
 **E.g.\<\\/b\>\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n**
 **Question 1\<\\/b\>: Strongly Disagree \\u2013 Strongly Agree.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n**
 **Question 2\<\\/b\>: Strongly Agree \\u2013 Strongly Disagree.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n**
                                                                This ensures that your data set isn\\u2019t weighted in favour of these respondents\\u2019 answers. Meaning, one end isn\\u2019t extremely disproportionate to the other.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                If you\\u2019ve already written all your questions and answers out, Shout has a feature for reversing the points of your scale.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                ### 11\. Always balance your scales\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                You should always have an equal number of positive and negative answer choices for scaled questions.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
 **E.g\<\\/b\>. Very Poor \| Poor \| Good \| Very Good \| Excellent\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n**
                                                                In the example above, you can see there are more positive answer choices than negative ones.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                As a result of this, [response bias\<\\/a\> could be created. For instance, respondents could be more likely to pick a positive answer because there\\u2019s more of them or start picking negative answers because they feel they\\u2019re being led the other way.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                By keeping survey answers balanced, you reduce the number of variables influencing respondent choices.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                ### 12\. Provide a neutral scale option\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                Respondents may not have an opinion on a subject or be unable to decide how they feel. To prepare for these cases, you\\u2019ll want to provide a neutral option. These are usually found at the centre of a Likert scale.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
 **E.g.\<\\/b\> Very Poor \| Poor \| No Opinion \| Good \| Very Good\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n**
                                                                These options can be very informative. Say you\\u2019re launching a customer satisfaction survey and receive a high percentage of respondents selecting \\u2018No Opinion\\u2019\. \<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                This could be an indicator that you\\u2019re putting too much emphasis on the wrong aspect of service or product, and your customers are looking to be engaged in some other way.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                With [close\-ended questions\<\\/a\>, the answer choices are just as important as the question text when it comes to gathering data.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                But with open\-ended questions, there\\u2019s more pressure on how you frame your question if you want the same quality in survey responses.
