SAAS VALUATION CALCULATOR
=========================

Valuate your SaaS business
--------------------------

Calculate an estimated valuation for your SaaS company based on annual recurring revenue and growth rate.

HOW TO USE THE SAAS VALUATION CALCULATOR

Start with a CSAT survey
------------------------

Use a Likert scale question to ask customers how satisfied they are with your product or service on a scale of Very Unsatisfied to Very Satisfied. Once you’ve collected responses, enter the number of respondents for each category into the CSAT calculator.

SaaS valuation calculator FAQs
------------------------------

We answer some of the most frequently asked questions about SaaS businesses.

### How is SaaS valuation calculated?

There are multiple methods by which you can calculate a valuation for your SaaS business. Let’s get into a few of those below.

**Multiple of Recurring Revenue** \= This method involves applying a multiple to the company’s recurring revenue, such as Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) or Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR). The multiple is often based on industry benchmarks or the company’s growth, profitability, and other factors.

**Net Profit Multiple** \= Some investors use the net profit (after all expenses) and apply a multiple to calculate the valuation.

**Market Multiples** \= Valuation can be derived by comparing the SaaS company to similar publicly traded companies or recent transactions in the industry. This may involve using metrics like the Price\-to\-Earnings (P/E) ratio.

For our calculator above, we used David Cumming’s formula for SaaS valuation:

SaaS valuation \= 2 x ARR \+ ARR x (1\+ 2\.5 x Growth Rate)

### What is the rule of 40?

The Rule of 40 is a metric commonly used to evaluate the balance between a SaaS company’s growth and profitability. The rule is expressed as the sum of the company’s growth rate and profitability margin, and the goal is for this sum to be equal to or greater than 40%.

The formula for the Rule of 40 is as follows:

Rule of 40 \= Revenue Growth Rate \+ Profit Margin

### What is the rule of 72?

The Rule of 72 is a formula used to estimate the number of years it takes for an investment to double in value, given a fixed annual rate of return. The formula for the Rule of 72 is as follows:

Years to Double \= 72 / Annual Return Rate (ARR)

### How to calculate ROI for SaaS?

Return on Investment is a metric that allows you to quantify the success of a campaign, product or strategy as a percentage. The formula for ROI is:

Return on Investment \= (Net Profit / Investment Cost) \* 100
