    What is Net Promoter Score?\<\\/h2\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        ------------------------------------------------

    Net Promoter Score (NPS) is the standard for measuring customer loyalty. This is gauged by their likelihood to recommend your product, service or brand to a friend or colleague.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    It is the correlation between a customer\\u2019s advocacy (i.e., positive word of mouth) and revenue growth that has made NPS a key metric in driving business development.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    ### What question do you ask to determine NPS?\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    To measure customer loyalty, you need to ask one simple question:\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

 **On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend this product to a friend or colleague?\<\\/b\>\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n**

    0 would be labelled with \\u2018Not at All Likely\\u2019 and 10 with \\u2018Extremely Likely\\u2019\.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    Your NPS question does not have to ask for a recommendation of a product, it can concern any aspect of your business. E.g., services, brand, websites, events or customer service.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n](\"#undefined\")](\"#undefined\")](\"#undefined\")](\"#undefined\")](\"#undefined\")](\"#undefined\")
