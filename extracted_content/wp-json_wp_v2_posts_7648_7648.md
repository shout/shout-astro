                                                            What is a lead capture page?\<\\/h2\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                -------------------------------------------------
                                                            A lead capture page is created with a specific intended action for prospects. They’re often used to collect contact information or to nurture leads through your sales funnel.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                            The type of lead capture page you used will depend on what leads you’re targetting in relation to their position in your funnel.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                            For example, if you still have a large number of prospects in the ‘Discovery\\/ Reach’ stage (top of the funnel), then you could create a lead page to encourage subscriptions to your email marketing list.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                            Alternatively, if you’re targetting leads at the lower end of your funnel you may decide to offer a free trial or product demo.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                            Either way, you’ll need to learn [how to calculate a lead score\<\\/a\> to determine which leads are worth the time spent by your sales stage.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                            ### Why are lead pages important?\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                            Lead pages are important not only because they allow you to collect contact details from leads, but also because they encourage potential customers to learn more about your product\\/ service\\/ organization.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                            And the more they know about you, the more trust is built. Which, in turn, generates quality leads and creates loyal customers.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                            How to optimize your lead capture page\<\\/h2\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                -----------------------------------------------------------
                                                            What elements you include and where you place them can determine whether your lead capture page will be effective. Here are our top tips for ensuring yours is a success:\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                            ### Minimize friction\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                            Leads will be resistant to handing over their contact information, especially this new age of stricter data protection awareness.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                            So, it’s important that you design your lead pages (and lead capture forms) to ensure there’s as little friction for prospects as possible.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
 **What is page friction?\<\\/b\>\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n**
                                                            This is caused by any page element (of content or design) that prevents or deters leads from converting. Some examples of page friction are:\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                            \\n
                                                                                    + Page length\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                    + Unappealing design\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                    + Competing CTAs\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                    + Bulky sections of text\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                    + Slow page loading times\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                    + Text that is too large (or too small)\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                    + Poorly written content (spelling and grammar)\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                    + Lack of a clear value proposition\<\\/li\>\\n\<\\/ul\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                        A high converting page will have taken all these factors into consideration. We also have an article about [lead form optimization\<\\/a\>, if you need some more tips regarding forms, fields and friction.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                        ### Strong call\-to\-action\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                        A great CTA is essential to increasing conversion rates on your lead capture pages. Strong CTAs create a sense of urgency in leads, encouraging them to take the action.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                        They should have an eye\-catching design, personalized and completing copy, be placed where it has maximum visibility and ideally they will allude to solving a problem for leads.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                        Why not take a look at our article on [writing a call\-to\-action that converts\<\\/a\>?\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                        ### Focus on the benefits of your offer\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                        This rule is a staple of any modern digital marketers content strategy. Leads want to see how your product or service can solve their problems, as opposed to a list of features.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                        But not everyone applies this strategy to advertizing, promotional and lead pages. Just because this content is more focussed on conversion, benefit\-central content is still the golden rule. Because it works.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                        Beyond working as a conversion strategy, it also creates consistency across your website content. And consistency is key to building and maintaining trust.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                        ### Personalized copy\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                        This is another golden rule for any copy on your website. It should be written in a way that feels personal to each individual readers.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                        This means more than just using second\-person (or even first\-person) personal pronouns. The copy itself should reflect the wants and needs of your audience. In doing so, you can easily frame your product or service (or deal) as the solution to those.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                        ### Form positioning\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                        More often than not, your form should be above the fold. If you’re not sure what that means, above the fold refers to content that’s visible before a leads scrolls or clicks. In other words, it’s the first content they see.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                        This is where people will be most engaged with your content. They expect to be hit all the information they need and the means of continuing without any further effort.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                        That’s why it’s essential to have a form there, you’re making the most of that peak engagement. If they need more information (i.e. a bit more of a push), that’s what the rest of your page content is for.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                        And this isn’t to say you can’t have another form at the tail end of your page. In\-fact we encourage it to capture leads who continue reading through your content. You could even set a pop\-up form to appear once leads reach maximum scroll depth or click away from the page.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                        ### Create a lead magnet\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                        Lead magnets are pieces of content or offers designed to incentivize leads and capture their contact information. This is to say, you’re offering leads something extra in return for handing over their details.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                        What type of lead magnet you create will depend on your audience’s needs. It’s essential that they’re targetted in this way for them to be effective.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                        Here are a few examples of lead magnets for you:\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

Single field forms will cast the widest net, as most leads will be happy to fill it out. However, a longer form requires more effort and time on the lead’s part. So, those who do fill it out show more commitment to your offer.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
