360 Feedback FAQs
-----------------

Everything you need to know about 360\-degree feedback surveys and how they can help you improve employee performance.

**#### What is 360\-degree feedback?

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]**

360 surveys are an effective feedback tool that provides team members with constructive and unbiased reviews. It aims to develop skills and behaviours in the workplace by identifying strengths and weaknesses.

The goal is not to criticise an individual on what they do wrong. It is to endorse their strengths and highlight areas for improvement.

**#### What do you measure with 360 reviews?

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]**

360\-degree feedback should address the entirety of an employee’s role. E.g. Creative skills, customer interaction, communication and leadership.

They should receive feedback from peers, subordinates, managers and potentially external sources such as customers or investors.

Any events or incidents should be accurately reported. This is to gauge impact in the workplace and whether their behaviour is consistent with organizational goals.

**#### How to analyze 360 feedback

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]**

All responses, including the self\-reflection, should be collated as an average for the 360 evaluation of the recipient. You should also compare the results of the self\-reflection against the larger group to identify the recipient’s ‘blind\-spots’.

Blind\-spots are areas where the recipient’s self\-evaluation differs to that of the reviewers.

**#### Why is 360 feedback important?

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]**

360 feedback surveys need to be anonymous to encourage open and honest reviews. These reviews help team members develop their overall performance and provide clear steps to grow their career.

The aim is not to inform promotions, raises or bonuses, but rather to increase productivity and engagement in the workplace.
