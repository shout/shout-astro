    Your customers are the lifeline of your business, and their experience with you is integral to your continued success. This is why customer satisfaction surveys are so important.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    Think about why they came to you in the first place; to solve a problem they had. By measuring customer satisfaction, you can identify what is working for them and what isn’t.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    What is a customer satisfaction survey?\<\\/h2\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                            ------------------------------------------------------------

    Customer satisfaction surveys are designed to collect feedback from customers in order to measure the success of different elements of your business.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    Opening a line of communication enables you to identify what makes your customers happy and what aspects need improvement.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    ### How to measure customer satisfaction\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    Whilst your customer survey will have a whole range of questions relating to their experience with you, it is possible to measure customer satisfaction by determining your CSAT score. You can do this by asking a single question, but the question type you use will impact how you calculate your score:\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    \\n
                                + Measuring CSAT with a scale\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                + Measuring CSAT with a binary question\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                + Measuring CSAT with a star rating\<\\/li\>\\n\<\\/ul\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                    #### Measuring CSAT with a scale\<\\/h4\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                    To measure your customer satisfaction score with a scaled question type, all you need to ask is:\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                    \\u2018How satisfied were you with the \[product\\/ service] you received?\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                    You can then provide a 1 to 5 (or even 1 to 10\) scale:\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                    \\n
                                        2. Very unsatisfied\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                        3. Unsatisfied\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                        4. Neutral\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                        5. Satisfied\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                        6. Very satisfied\<\\/li\>\\n\<\\/ol\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                            <img src='\"https:\/\/wp-stagesh.bugfree.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Measuring-CSAT-With-A-Scale.png\"' alt='\"Measuring' title='' width='\"800\"' height='\"274\"' />\<\\/figure\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                            Then, to calculate your score you\\u2019ll need to add up all the individual scores given, divide this by the maximum score possible and multiply that number by 100\. This will give you your CSAT score as a percentage.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                            #### Measuring CSAT with a binary question\<\\/h4\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                            Measuring customer satisfaction with a binary (or dichotomous) question only requires two answer choices.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                            \\u2018Are you satisfied with the \[product\\/ service] you received?\\u2019\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                            \\n
                                                - Yes\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                - No\<\\/li\>\\n\<\\/ul\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    <img src='\"https:\/\/wp-stagesh.bugfree.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Measuring-CSAT-With-A-Binary-Question.png\"' alt='\"Binary' title='' width='\"800\"' height='\"274\"' />\<\\/figure\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    To calculate your CSAT score with this method, you\\u2019ll need to divide the total number of positive (\\u2018yes\\u2019\) responses by the total number of responses received, then multiply this number by 100\.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    You can also apply this calculation to a scaled question, by dividing all respondents who chose the top two numbers in the scale by the maximum score possible and multiplying that by 100\.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    #### Measuring CSAT with a star rating\<\\/h4\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    Star ratings are more general in nature, they\\u2019re not usually used to explore specific customer experiences. However, they are useful for giving a more zoomed out perspective of how your customers feel about you.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    \\u2018How would you rate your experience with us?\\u2019\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    <img src='\"https:\/\/wp-stagesh.bugfree.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Measuring-CSAT-With-A-Star-Rating.png\"' alt='\"Measure' title='' width='\"800\"' height='\"274\"' />\<\\/figure\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    The calculation for a star rating is as follows; the total number of stars given divided by the maximum number of stars achievable, multiplied by 5 (the total number of stars a respondent is able to award).\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    Other types of Customer Satisfaction Surveys\<\\/h2\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    -----------------------------------------------------------------
                                                    Customer satisfaction is directly influenced by their experiences. But there are other types of customer (or client) satisfaction surveys that you can conduct that tell you more about the way they feel about your business.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    Two examples of these are Net Promoter Score surveys and Customer Effort Score surveys.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    ### Net Promoter Score (NPS)\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    [NPS surveys\<\\/a\> are used to determine your customer loyalty. You can quantify this by asking them one simple question:\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    \\u2018How likely are you to recommend \[product\\/ service] to a friend or colleague?\\u2019\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    To answer this question, customers choose a rating on an 11\-point scale (0 to 10\), from \\u2018Not Very Likely At All\\u2019 to \\u2018Extremely Likely\\u2019\.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    <img src='\"https:\/\/wp-stagesh.bugfree.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Net-Promoter-Score-Question-Shout.png\"' alt='\"Net' title='' width='\"800\"' height='\"274\"' />\<\\/figure\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    Respondents are split into three categories based on what rating they select along this scale:\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    0 to 6 \= Demoters  
                                                    7 or 8 \= Passives  
                                                    9 and 10 \= Promoters\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    #### Calculating your Net Promoter Score\<\\/h4\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    [NPS is calculated\<\\/a\> by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters. Your final score will be between \-100 and 100, where anything over 0 is considered a good score.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    ### Customer Effort Score (CES)\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    CES surveys are used to measure how easy a specific action or process was for a customer to complete. The purpose of these surveys is to identify areas of friction, so you can remove them and [improve customer experience\<\\/a\>. The types of things you can measure customer effort for are:\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    \\n
                                                    * Navigating your website\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    * Making an online purchase\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    * Finding resources (e.g. help docs)\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    * Customer support\<\\/li\>\\n\<\\/ul\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    Again, you can calculate your customer effort score with a scale (1 to 10\) or a binary question (easy or hard). When using a scale, divide the sum of all your CES by the total number of responses.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    If you use a binary question, simply subtract the percentage of positive responses from the percentage of negative responses.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    When using a neutral answer option, you can ignore this when calculating CES in this way.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    Why are Customer Satisfaction Surveys important?\<\\/h2\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                        ---------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                    It\\u2019s essential that you reach out to your customers for this information because there\\u2019s no guarantee they\\u2019d get in touch with you if they have an issue. It\\u2019s even less likely that customers will get in touch to tell you you\\u2019re doing a good job. This same logic applies to your customers sharing their experiences with others.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    A [survey found that 95% of respondents\<\\/a\> who had a bad experience shared it with someone they knew. This kind of negative word\-of\-mouth can be detrimental to generating new leads and customers. These respondents who had a bad experience were also 50% more likely to share their experience on social media and review sites, which can be permanently damaging to your brand.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    This is why it\\u2019s so important to ask your customers how satisfied they are before an issue snowballs.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    Other than avoiding these kinds of nightmare scenarios, there are also major benefits to running customer satisfaction surveys.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    \\n
                                                    2. Feedback can be used to improve products and customer experience\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                3. Identify gaps in your product or service\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                4. Discover loyal customers who can become advocates\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                5. Find out why ex\-customer switched to a competitor\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                6. Collect testimonials and success stories\<\\/li\>\\n\<\\/ol\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    ### 1\. Feedback can be used to improve products and customer experience\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    There\\u2019s a whole range of things you want to ask customers about your product. Is it good value for money? Did the quality meet their expectations? Was it delivered on time? How does it compare to competitor products they have experience with?\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    Asking customers these questions shows them you care about their experience and will improve customer retention and loyalty in the long run.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    ### 2\. Identify gaps in your product or service\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    Customer feedback isn\\u2019t just useful for improving experiences and reducing fiction. It also allows you to identify what\\u2019s missing from your product range, your service or even the availability of information.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    Customers could be ecstatic with everything you\\u2019re doing, but may still go to competitors for features or products that you\\u2019re missing. This might not be something you can address immediately, but this kind of feedback gives you the edge when choosing how to expand your business.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    ### 3\. Discover loyal customers who can become advocates for your brand\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    While it\\u2019s important to know what problems your customers have, it\\u2019s equally as important to know what you\\u2019re doing well and why. Identifying customers who\\u2019re completely satisfied with your products\\/ service enables you to create customer profiles ([buyer personas\<\\/a\>) for your perfect target audiences.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    Not only does this make your marketing efforts easier, but it also provides you with an audience who\\u2019s happy and willing to advocate for you.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    ### 4\. Find out why ex\-customers switched to a competitor\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

Both CSAT and NPS questions require you to use a scale to measure satisfaction and loyalty respectively.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are three types of scales you can use. The first is a standard numbered [opinion scale\<\\/a\> where respondents select a number, e.g. between 1 and 10\. The second is a](\"https:\/\/wp-stagesh.bugfree.co.uk\/help\/article\/50-opinion-scales\") [slider\<\\/a\>, which also requires respondents to select a number. Both ends of these scales are labelled to provide context to respondents, e.g. \\u2018Not Very Good\\u2019 and \\u2018Extremely Good\\u2019\.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nThe final type is a Likert scale (called a [Matrix\<\\/a\> here on Shout), which are also numbered, but each point along the scale has a label.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

Keep surveys short and sweet\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\nThe longer your survey is, the more likely it is that respondents will suffer from survey fatigue, which can impact your survey completion rate. Before you start writing questions, think about the aim of this particular survey and what data you actually need (right now).\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is for your benefit as much as your respondents. Collecting too much data can be overwhelming, it\\u2019s better to collect a more manageable set and action changes one at a time.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                                                        2\. Ask the right questions at the right time\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\nFollowing on from our last tip, it\\u2019s important to split your surveys up by their context. Not only does this keep them short and targeted, it also ensures you\\u2019re collecting the right data at the right time.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nFor example, if you\\u2019re conducting an NPS survey, avoid asking questions about customer effort or satisfaction with individual experiences. You risk muddying your results or skewing respondents’ answer choices when mixing and matching these types of questions.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is also important as each survey should be used at a different place in the [customer journey\<\\/a\>.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                                                        3\. Ensure questions are neutral\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen [writing survey questions\<\\/a\>, you\\u2019ll need to make sure the language you used doesn\\u2019t influence the way respondents answer. Loaded language that’s evocative or leading questions that nudge respondents to choose a specific answer will leave you with a useless set of results.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the best quality data, write questions in a neutral way that encourages customers to express their own opinion.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                                                        4\. Test before you send\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\nIt\\u2019s an unfortunate trend in survey research to distribute before testing it yourself. It\\u2019s totally understandable that you\\u2019ve spent all this time writing the perfect questions for your goal and want to start collecting feedback, but it\\u2019s important that you don\\u2019t skip this step.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nYou\\u2019ll want to check that your survey is void of any spelling or grammatical error and that all your questions make sense in the context of the survey. Secondly, you can use this opportunity to put yourself in your customers\\u2019 shoes to see if there are any biases or order effects induced by the survey.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you want to go one step further (and we think you should), you can collect some dummy responses from your colleagues or a small pilot group to get an idea of what your feedback will look like.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nThis gives you the opportunity to chop and change your survey if the results aren\\u2019t as useful as you expected.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nFinally, it also gives you the opportunity to check the technical elements of your survey. If you\\u2019re using an online [survey maker\<\\/a\>, it\\u2019s likely you\\u2019ll be employing features like](\"https:\/\/wp-stagesh.bugfree.co.uk\/survey-maker\/\") [Question Logic\<\\/a\> and](\"https:\/\/wp-stagesh.bugfree.co.uk\/help\/article\/64-default-logic\") [Text Piping\<\\/a\> to personalize survey content. It\\u2019s much harder to fix these things if your survey is live and has already collected responses.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                                                        5\. Act on feedback and follow up with customers\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\nThere\\u2019s no point collecting all this feedback if you don\\u2019t intend to act on it. The only question you need to ask yourself is when and how you will act on it.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nYou\\u2019re going to receive a lot of different opinions and some of them will be contrasting, it\\u2019s up to you to decide how much of your audience needs to agree in order for their feedback to create change.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nBut this isn\\u2019t the final step, you should then get in touch with customers to let them know that you acted on their feedback.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nThis will show them you\\u2019ve gone above and beyond to improve their experience and will go a long way in improving customer loyalty and retention.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
