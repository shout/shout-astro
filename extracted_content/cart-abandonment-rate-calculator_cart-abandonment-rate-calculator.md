Cart Abandonment Rate

Find out how much revenue your cart abandonments are losing you per year.

HOW TO USE THE CART ABANDONMENT RATE CALCULATOR

What you need…
--------------

Calculating your cart abandonment rate is simple. All you’ll need is the number of visits to your cart (per month), the number of purchases made (per month), and the average order value. We’ll alos show you how much potential revenue you’re missing out on.

Cart abandonment rate calculator FAQs
-------------------------------------

Everything you need to know about cart abandonment rate.

### What is cart abandonment?

Cart abandonment rate is a metric used in e\-commerce to measure the percentage of online shopping carts that are abandoned by users before completing the purchase. It represents the ratio of abandoned carts to the total number of initiated transactions or completed purchases.

Here’s a breakdown of the concept:

**Abandoned Cart**: When a customer adds items to their online shopping cart but leaves the website or app without completing the purchase.

**Cart Abandonment Rate**: It is calculated by dividing the number of abandoned carts by the total number of initiated transactions (which includes both completed purchases and abandoned carts) and multiplying by 100 to get a percentage.

**Calculate the cost of acquiring new customers with our [customer acquisition cost calculator](https://shout.com/customer-acquisition-cost-calculator/).**

### How do you calculate cart abandonment rate?

To calculate the cart abandonment rate, you typically follow these steps:

1. **Determine the time frame**: Decide on the time period for which you want to calculate the abandonment rate. This could be a day, a week, a month, etc.
2. **Count the number of completed purchases**: This is the total number of transactions successfully completed within your chosen time frame.
3. **Count the number of abandoned carts**: This is the total number of shopping carts that were created but the purchase was not completed within your chosen time frame.
4. **Calculate the abandonment rate** using the formula:

Cart abandonment rate \= Number of abandoned carts / (number of completed purchases \+ Number of abandoned carts)

If you don’t have access to your number of abandoned carts, you can calculate this by subtracting your total number of purchases from the number of visits to the cart.

### What is a good cart abandonment rate?

According to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/477804/online-shopping-cart-abandonment-rate-worldwide/), the average cart abandonment rate is 70\.19%. This means that any CAR that falls between 60% and 80% can be considered good, although if you fall below that average you’re already doing well.

However, you should also consider the average cart abandonment rates for each industry:

| Industry | Average Cart Abandonment Rate |
| --- | --- |
| Fashion, accessories, and apparel | 77\.48% |
| Pet care and veterinary services | 55\.95% |
| Luxury and jewellery | 77\.50% |
| Beauty and personal care | 83\.29% |
| Home and furniture | 79\.05% |
| Food and beverage | 38\.68% |

### How to improve cart abandonment rate?

Reducing cart abandonment rate is crucial for improving conversion rates and maximizing revenue in e\-commerce. Here are several strategies you can implement to improve your cart abandonment rate:

* **Optimize Website Performance**: Ensure that your website loads quickly and is mobile\-friendly. A slow or poorly optimized website can frustrate users and lead to cart abandonment.
* **Streamline Checkout Process**: Simplify the checkout process as much as possible. Minimize the number of steps required to complete a purchase and offer guest checkout options to avoid forcing users to create an account.
* **Transparent Pricing**: Be upfront about pricing, including taxes, shipping costs, and any additional fees. Unexpected costs at checkout are a common reason for cart abandonment.
* **Offer Multiple Payment Options**: Provide a variety of payment options to accommodate different preferences and needs. Accept major credit cards, digital wallets, and alternative payment methods like PayPal.
* **Implement Trust Signals**: Display trust badges, security seals, and customer reviews to reassure users about the security of their personal and financial information.
* **Use Exit\-Intent Popups**: Implement exit\-intent popups to capture users who are about to abandon their carts. Offer incentives such as discounts or free shipping to encourage them to complete their purchase.
* **Send Abandoned Cart Emails**: Set up automated email campaigns to remind users about their abandoned carts and encourage them to return to complete their purchase. Offer incentives or discounts to incentivize conversion.
* **Optimize Product Pages**: Ensure that product pages provide clear and detailed information, including high\-quality images, product descriptions, sizing charts, and availability status.
* **Enable Guest Checkout**: Allow users to complete their purchases without requiring them to create an account. Simplifying the checkout process can reduce friction and encourage more conversions.
* **Implement Remarketing Campaigns**: Use retargeting ads on social media platforms and other websites to remind users about products they’ve added to their carts but haven’t purchased yet.

By implementing these strategies and continually monitoring your cart abandonment rate, you can optimize your e\-commerce website for improved conversion rates and increased sales.
