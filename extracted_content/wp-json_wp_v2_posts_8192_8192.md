                                        Quizzes are a simple and effective marketing tool for both generating leads and engaging your existing customers.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                        They’re so effective because they’re easy and fun to fill out, offer a reward (in the form of results), and cost you very little in the way of resources or time.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                        Asides from being a cheap method of engaging prospective customers, they also offer a way of gaining insight on prospects to allow for lead segmentation in future campaigns.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                        Why quizzes generate leads\<\\/h2\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                    -----------------------------------------------
                                        Quizzes are so successful as lead generation tools because they offer personalized results and naturally encourage sharing. But, let’s dig into why these factors mean that quizzes generate leads and how that’d good for you.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
 **Personalized results:\<\\/b\>\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n**
                                        Quizzes capitalize on a lead’s desire to discover or confirm something about themselves, which is to say they appeal to a curiosity in your audience.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
 **Shareability:\<\\/b\>\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n**
                                        The quiz format naturally encourages leads to share their results, which increases exposure for your quiz and generates more leads.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                        The best thing about using quizzes for lead generation is that you can create them for any audience. Your topic can be chosen based on industry, sector, role, interests or something more generic (like a personality quiz).\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                        As long as your topic\\/ title entices leads by targetting that curiosity, you’re bound to see some good results. For example:\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                        \\n
                                                                        * What type of marketer are you?\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                        * What is your personality type?\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                        * Should you hire a GDPR consultant?\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                        * Any employee should know these 5 things about their job\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

                                                                        * What body shape are you?\<\\/li\>\\n\<\\/ul\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                            How to create a lead capture quiz\<\\/h2\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                            ------------------------------------------------------
                                                                            Shout’s [Quiz Builder\<\\/a\> is the perfect tool for building lead generation quizzes. Using the drag and drop builder to add questions, a pre\-built form for capturing leads and robust features for showing scores and writing personalized results, creating quizzes couldn’t be easier.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                            Just follow these steps and you’ll be good to go in no time:\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                            \\n
                                                                                2. Tailor your quiz to your audience\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                3. Add a lead form\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                4. Create personalized results\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                5. Follow up with a welcome email\<\\/li\>\\n\<\\/ol\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                    ### 1\. Tailor your quiz to your audience\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                    Evaluate what you know about your target audience and create a quiz that’s tailored to their interests. On top of this, frame your quiz in a way that focuses on leads’ problems or concerns. Then you can address these in the results or in a follow\-up email once you’ve collected their contact information.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                    Think about it as writing quiz questions to lead back to the service or product you provide and the hinting at the solution (your product or service) in quiz results.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                    ### 2\. Add a lead capture form\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                    For the highest conversion rate, place your lead capture form between the last question page and the results page. This will encourage leads to enter their information in return for their results.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                    People are reluctant to hand over personal information, so if you place the lead capture form at the start, quiz takers may leave before answering questions.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                    Placing the lead form at the end means that leads will have something to lose if they leave and something to gain if they fill out your form.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                    ### 3\. Create a rewarding set of results\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                    When creating a lead generation quiz, it can be easy to put all your energy into writing questions but fail to provide a robust set of results for quiz takers.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                    This can block leads from moving down the sales funnel and converting because the reward for their time and their personal details is lacklustre.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                    It can also be a detriment to the ‘sharability’ of your quiz, which is something you’ll be relying on to increase your brand exposure. If people don’t feel that your content is rewarding or valuable, they certainly won’t share it with their friends and colleagues.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                    [Word\-of\-mouth marketing\<\\/a\> is how content goes viral online, so it’s really important that your quiz takers want to share their results (and in turn sharing your quiz and branding) within their circle.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                    A successful quiz provides a detailed set of results that answer the questions leads had about themselves when they started. It should be something interesting that they would think to share with their friends and that encourages others to take your quiz for themselves to see how they differ.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                    ### 4\. Follow up with a welcome email\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                    Once a lead has reached this point, you’ve already engaged them and collected their contact information. But you don’t want this to feel like their last interaction with you, so you’ll want to think about how you can continue this relationship.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                    A welcome email is a great way to ‘warm’ leads. This is important because you don’t want them to forget about you the moment they get their quiz results, you want to foster a long\-term relationship.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                    Use the welcome email to share a little more about yourself (or your brand) and how you can help solve your leads’ problems. Do anything you can to build trust and provide value so that they keep coming back to you in the future.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                    Take a look at our article on [how to write welcome emails\<\\/a\> that keeps subscribers reading for more tips on improving welcome email engagement.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

                                                                                                3. Write an eye\-catching title\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                                4. Keep the quiz short\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

                                                                                                7. Test, test, test\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                                8. Share your quiz in the right places\<\\/li\>\\n\<\\/ol\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                    ### 1\. Pick a topic based on your audience\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                    For your lead capture quiz to perform well initially, it has to be tailored to your target audience. If your quiz has no bearing on their life or interests, it will fail before it begins.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                    You might not be intimate with your audience (yet!), but you will know at least one thing about them; a shared problem or something they enjoy. Pick a topic based on this and write your questions to prime quiz takers for what you eventually want to market to them.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

                                                                                    Make a strong first impression with a snappy, captivating title that challenges people to click and start answers.

                                                                                    ### 4\. Add rich media to boost engagement\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

                                                                                    ### 5\. Keep your lead form short\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
