    What is a close\-ended question?\<\\/h2\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                            -----------------------------------------------------

    Close\-ended questions are those that start with \\u2018Can\\u2019, \\u2018Did\\u2019, \\u2018Will\\u2019 or \\u2018Have\\u2019\. Most commonly, they take the form of multiple\-choice questions, where respondents choose from a set list of answers.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    You would use closed\-ended questions to collect quantitative data. From which you\\u2019d determine some \\u2018statistical significance\\u2019\. They\\u2019re usually simpler than their open\-ended counterparts, allowing respondents to quickly answer.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    ### Examples of close\-ended questions\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    Typically, closed questions will have a one\-word answer, such as \\u2018yes\\u2019 or \\u2018no. In these cases you would ask questions like:\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    \\n
                                + Do you like our service?\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                + Is London the capital of England?\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                + Can you run 5 kilometres?\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                + Have you enjoyed the event?\<\\/li\>\\n\<\\/ul\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                    However, there are examples of close\-ended questions that require answers other than yes or no.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                    \\n
                                        - What year were you born?\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

                                        - Which university did you attend?\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                        - How often do use public transport?\<\\/li\>\\n\<\\/ul\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

                                            ------------------------------------------
                                            Open questions ask participants to write unique responses, which are free form. They\\u2019re more suited to exploratory research that looks to describe a subject based on trends and patterns. However, they require more effort and time to answer.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                            ### Examples of open\-ended questions\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

                                                    Differences between open\-ended and close\-ended questions\<\\/h2\>\\n\\n\\n\\nThe difference between open\-ended and closed\-ended questions lies in the data they collect. Closed questions collect data that can be used to draw generalized conclusions based on statistical analysis.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nOpen\-ended questions ask respondents to describe a subject. You\\u2019d then look for trends and patterns in the responses you\\u2019ve collected. Think of these question styles as \\u2018tasks\\u2019 with different outputs.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, the quality of data you collect depends on the way you write questions. E.g. If you write leading questions, your data will not be accurate. Learn [how to write survey questions\<\\/a\>.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    Advantages of closed\-ended questions\<\\/h2\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

                                                        + People are more likely to answer sensitive questions\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

                                                            Disadvantages of closed\-ended questions\<\\/h2\>\\n\\n\\n\\nConversely, here are a few problems with using closed questions:\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                \\n- Your answer lists can provoke choices that participants otherwise wouldn\\u2019t make\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                - Some respondents may feel that none of the set answers reflects their own opinion or experience. In these cases, they may choose to skip the question or even select an answer at random\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                - Too many answer choices may deter or confuse respondents. So, you should only provide the most important and relevant options. See our article on writing survey answers\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                - It\\u2019s difficult to identify those who misunderstand a question and choose the wrong answer as a result\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                - The format of close\-ended questions may be too simple for complex issues. Especially if a respondent wants to provide more detail on a subject\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                - To identify \\u2018statistical significance\\u2019 in results, you\\u2019ll need to collect a larger data set\<\\/li\>\\n\<\\/ul\>\\n\\n\\n\\nAs close\-ended questions have specific answers, they must be consistent and clear. Any ambiguity can affect the way people answer and can lead to different [types of response bias\<\\/a\>.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                    Tips for using close\-ended questions\<\\/h2\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                    1\. Become an expert but write questions for those who aren’t\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\nIt\\u2019s important to fully understand your research topic to ask the right questions and provide the right answers. It\\u2019s also your job to translate what you know into terms that are understandable for respondents.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nIf they can\\u2019t understand your questions or answers, then the data you collect will be at risk.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                    2\. Keep questions simple and clear\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\nYour questions should be specific and concise. The longer and more complex questions are, the more likely participants are to misinterpret or disengage.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                    3\. Ensure answer choices are exclusive and exhaustive\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\nEnsure that the answer choices for closed questions are both exhaustive and exclusive.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nExhaustive answer lists are those that provide the entire range of choices (e.g. Very Unsatisfied \\u2013 Very Satisfied).\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nExclusive answer lists ensure no choices share intent or meaning. The most common form of this is where numbered groups overlap, e.g. 18\-25, 25\-35, 35\-45\. If a participant is 25 they won\\u2019t know whether to select 18\-25 or 25\-35\.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, words with similar or indistinguishable meanings can also cause issues, e.g. \\u2018Fine\\u2019 and \\u2018Satisfactory\\u2019\.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                    4\. Only provide relevant answers\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\nYou should be able to anticipate what kind of answers respondents will give for each question.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you can\\u2019t, your question may be too broad or complex.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                    Closed\-ended question examples for surveys\<\\/h2\>\\n\\n\\n\\nBelow are a few examples of closed questions in surveys.
