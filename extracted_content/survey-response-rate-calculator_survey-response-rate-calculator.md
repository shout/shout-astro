SURVEY RESPONSE RATE CALCULATOR
===============================

Calculate your response rate
----------------------------

Track how well your survey has performed with respondents with our free survey response rate calculator.

HOW TO USE THE SURVEY RESPONSE RATE CALCULATOR

Start with a survey
-------------------

Once you’ve created a survey and collected responses, take note of the number of respondents you shared the survey with and the total number who respondent. Enter those values into the survey response rate calculator and we’ll do the rest.

Survey Response Rate Calculator FAQs
------------------------------------

Everything you need to know about survey response rates and their importance to your research.

### What is survey response rate?

Survey response rate is a metric that shows the percentage of people invited to respond to a survey that submitted a response.

Typically, you would use this metric to determine how representative a sample is of your intended audience. But it’s also a great indicator of how successful your campaign has been.

### How is response rate calculated?

Survey response rates are calculated by dividing the total number of survey responses by the number of invitations sent to an audience (sample size). You then multiply that value by 100 for your response rate.

Survey response rate formula \= Survey Responses % Survey Invitations \* 100

For example, if you receive 1200 responses from a sample of 1500, you will have a response rate of 80\.00%

### Response rate vs completion rate

Some people believe the terms response rate and completion rate are synonymous. But, in online survey research, they are considered two separate metrics.

Where response rate is meant to identify the percentage of your sample to respond to your survey, completion rate illustrates the percentage of respondents who completed your survey.

How is this different? Well, respondents may submit a partial response to your survey but dropout before completion. Completion rate identifies respondents who reach the end of your survey.

So, it’s likely that your survey response rate will usually be higher than your completion rate.

### Why is survey response rate important?

Your survey responses rate is meant to determine whether your respondents are representative of a wider sample. A low response rate would mean your results is not representative, whereas a high response rate would indicate a representative set of results.

If you’re struggling to find survey respondents, take a look at how to increase survey response rates.
