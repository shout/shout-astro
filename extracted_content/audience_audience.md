Audience Panels FAQs
--------------------

**#### How much does it cost to buy survey responses?

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]**

The cost of survey audiences depends on three factors:

* How many questions your survey contains (how long it takes to complete your survey on average).
* How many survey responses you request.
* What additional targeting criteria you set.

**#### What targeting criteria is included in the cost of responses?

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]**

With the standard cost of your audience panel, you’ll be able to target survey respondents based on:

* Location (Country, State, City).
* Age.
* Gender.

Using additional targeting criteria may increase the cost of your audience.

**#### What other variables can I use to target respondents?

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]**

Shout offers too many other targeting variables to list here, but here are a few examples:

* Household (number of children, pets, marital status, etc.)
* Finance (Personal income, household income, investable assets, etc.)
* Automotive (Type of car, new or used car, car purchase year, etc.)
* Business \& occupation (Industry sector, company size, primary role in organization, etc.)
* Travel (Types of holidays, hotels frequented, airlines flown in the past year, etc.)
* Healthcare consumer (Glasses, someone in household diagnosed, hearing aids, etc.)
* Electronics (Electronic products, internet connection, early adopter, etc.)
* Hobbies \& interests (Gaming, music preferences, purchased movies, etc.)
* Education (Major at university/ college, levels of study – university, graduation year, etc.)

**#### How long will it take to collect my responses?

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]**

This will depend on the size and specificity of your audience, but typically your responses will be collected within the first couple of days.

In most cases, your responses will be fully collected within a day.
