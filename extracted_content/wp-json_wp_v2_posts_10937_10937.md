                        The market research industry in the UK is continuing to grow despite a slight slowdown due to the pandemic. As [figures from Research Live\<\\/a\> have found, more than half of the companies involved in the area grew in the past year.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        It shows just how key of an industry it is to grow through what has been an unstable time for businesses right across the country and the world.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        Companies all turn to organisations that specialise in market research to gain knowledge for many reasons. It could be to keep up with current trends, find a target market, maintain a competitive edge over competitors, or better understand your customers’ needs.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        Therefore, if you’re considering conducting a [marketing survey\<\\/a\> to gather information about your business, you need to ensure its effectiveness. The only way to achieve this is by asking the right marketing questions.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        But how do you go about do this?\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        Have a clear strategy\<\\/h2\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                ------------------------------------------
                        This is the fundamental part of any survey; you need to ask yourself one critical question before you start. What do you want to achieve from the survey?\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        It’s worth pondering the [principles of marketing multiple choice questions and answers\<\\/a\> before you start writing questions. Understanding how customers interact with certain types of questions is essential to writing effective marketing questions.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        If you don’t have a marketing strategy, why are you even spending time going out into the world for your research?\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        Therefore, with a plan to refer to, elements of your questioning will already be dictated. For instance, if you aim to improve your product, then a simple question for customers is how well the product suits their needs.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        The responses could provide vital information into potential development opportunities in the future.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n](\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/book\/313617112\/Principles-of-Marketing-Multiple-Choice-Questions-and-Answers-MCQs-Quiz-Practice-Tests-with-Answer-Key-Business-Quick-Study-Guides-Encyclopedi\")](\"https:\/\/wp-stagesh.bugfree.co.uk\/market-research-surveys\/\")](\"https:\/\/www.research-live.com\/article\/news\/market-research-industry-grows-despite-covid19\/id\/5093482\")](\"#undefined\")](\"#undefined\")](\"#undefined\")](\"#undefined\")](\"#power-your-market-research\")](\"#undefined\")
