At Shout, our development team has been working hard on a complete overhaul of a range of features across the site.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

And finally, we can share the results of all this hard work with you!\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

So, let\\u2019s get into a complete rundown of everything new and what changes we\\u2019ve made to the app.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

What’s new?\<\\/h2\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
--------------------------------

Firstly, let’s get stuck into all the new features you\\u2019ll have access to.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

### Research and Marketing CRM\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

We\\u2019ve completely changed the way you store and manage your contacts on Shout. Our new CRM system allows you to [import contacts\<\\/a\> and group them based on the type of campaigns you intend to send, whilst also tracking your lawful basis of processing their data.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

Meaning, you not only have a way of storing contacts logically but will also be able to ensure you\\u2019re [GDPR compliant\<\\/a\> whilst doing so.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

#### Groups\<\\/h4\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

This feature was previously known as Email Lists in the app. These were basic function contact lists that had to be built manually.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

We\\u2019ve added new and exciting functionality to how these lists work and donned them, Groups.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
