    What is survey design?\<\\/h2\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
        -------------------------------------------

    Survey design is the way a survey or questionnaire is created to maximize response rates and improve the quality of data collected.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    A good design is essential for conducting successful survey research. So, we\\u2019ve put together a list of tips to make your surveys more effective and efficient at collecting responses.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    These suggestions will apply to your research, whether you\\u2019re measuring customer loyalty, evaluating job satisfaction or collecting event feedback.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    ### Online survey design\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    Online surveys will have more options than other forms of [survey research\<\\/a\> when it comes to personalization and customization.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    Because of this, some of our tips won\\u2019t be as applicable to all research methods. For example, visual design and feature usage won\\u2019t apply to interview\-based research.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    But there\\u2019s no need to worry, you\\u2019ll still find heaps of the best practices for survey design below.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    ### Problems caused by poor survey design\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    If a survey is written poorly, it will inevitably lead to respondents experiencing [survey fatigue\<\\/a\>.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    This is where a participant becomes disengaged from a survey, usually because of complexity, length, or a lack of clarity.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    If you\\u2019re running a branded survey, survey fatigue can customers’ opinion of your brand.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    In the worst cases, fatigue (and poor survey design) can lead to the occurrence of [response bias\<\\/a\> (aka survey bias).\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    These biases usually manifest as dishonest or inaccurate responses, which can damage your survey results.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    There are other forms of response that aren\\u2019t caused by poor design. But that doesn\\u2019t mean they won\\u2019t impact your results.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

                                                    \\n2. Introduction\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    3. Screening questions\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    4. Questionnaire\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    5. Thank participants\<\\/li\>\\n\<\\/ol\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                        1\. Introduction\<\\/h4\>\\n\\n\\n\\nThis section can be used to inform participants how long a survey is going to take and what they should expect from the questions ahead.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nBut there are a few other things you could do here to improve your survey design and engage with respondents.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                        Welcome respondents\<\\/h5\>\\n\\n\\n\\nWelcoming your survey participants is a great way to build relationships. It reminds them they\\u2019re working with another human, and not a faceless data collection machine.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nThis will also make your survey a little less formal, allowing respondents to relax and answer more naturally.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                        Summarize your research\<\\/h5\>\\n\\n\\n\\nYou should also consider preparing a summary of your research. This will make participants and respondent feel like they\\u2019re contributing something.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, avoid sharing any specific aims goals, as doing so can influence participants responses and create response bias in your results.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                        Collect Consent\<\\/h5\>\\n\\n\\n\\nThe introduction is also where you\\u2019ll want to collect consent from participants (if you need to do so), to process their data.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nYou don\\u2019t want to make your introduction too lengthy, this may deter some respondents from continuing. Just do what you can to let participants know you value their time and effort.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                        2\. Screening questions\<\\/h4\>\\n\\n\\n\\nThese questions, sometimes called qualification questions, are used to disqualify participants who don\\u2019t match your target population.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nFor example, you may only want to survey respondents from a specific location. So, you\\u2019d place a screening question at the beginning of your questionnaire asking for a respondent’s zip\\/ postcode.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nThen if they do not match your specifications, you can disregard their responses. Or, if you\\u2019re conducting a survey online, you could use [Question Logic\<\\/a\> to send disqualified respondents straight to an exit page.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, if you\\u2019re purchasing a respondent panel for your online survey, these question won\\u2019t be necessary.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                        3\. Questionnaire\<\\/h4\>\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are some general guidelines you should follow when it comes to writing a survey, which we\\u2019ll cover in the next section.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, there are two major rules you should adhere to when designing questions.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                        Save sensitive and demographic questions for the end of your survey\<\\/h5\>\\n\\n\\n\\nThe vast majority of people don\\u2019t like giving personal information or detailing sensitive aspects of their life (e.g. whether they\\u2019re divorced). If you start with these questions, respondents are more likely to drop\-out early.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nLeaving those questions until the end has two positives. Firstly, you\\u2019ll have already collected a bulk of data on the participant. So, you won\\u2019t lose too much if they drop out.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nSecondly, respondents may be more inclined to answer those questions at the end simply because they\\u2019ve already completed everything else.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nDon\\u2019t ask for personal information if you don\\u2019t need it. We can\\u2019t stress that enough. Respondents will see straight through surveys shamelessly collecting personal data, and they won\\u2019t like it.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                        Ensure your question order is logical\<\\/h5\>\\n\\n\\n\\nThis next rule is somewhat related to the one above, but it applies to your entire questionnaire.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nThink of your survey like a narrative, where one line of questioning naturally leads to another. Out of place questions will feel irrelevant and may impact your completion rate.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nIt\\u2019s important to keep in mind that your question order can also affect the way people respond.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is especially true when one question changes the context of another or leads respondents to continue answering in a certain way.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nHere\\u2019s an example from [Pew Research in a study on questionnaire design\<\\/a\>:\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Question 1: \\u2018Do you approve or disapprove of the way George W. Bush is handling his job as president?\\u2019\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nQuestion 2: \\u2018All in all, are you satisfied or dissatisfied with the way things are going in this country today?\\u2019”\<\\/p\>\\nPew Research\<\\/cite\>\<\\/blockquote\>\\n\\n\\n\\n88% of people said they were dissatisfied with the state of the US when asked Question 2 after Question 1, whereas only 78% answered as dissatisfied without the context of Question 1\.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nThis isn\\u2019t a huge variance, but it is enough to determine that question order can impact survey responses.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                        4\. Thank respondents\<\\/h4\>\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can thank respondents for completing your survey in a few ways.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                            \\n- Offer an incentive or prize\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                            - Provide a discount or coupon for your product or service\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                            - Just say thanks!\<\\/li\>\\n\<\\/ul\>\\n\\n\\n\\nBy thanking a respondent for their time or rewarding them for filling out your survey, you increase the chance that they will respond to one of your future projects.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nAlthough, you may want to give some thought about whether to offer an incentive. This can encourage participants to respond to win the prize, rather than to contribute to your research.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                Understand your question format\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are two main survey question formats you should be aware of before designing a survey: open and closed\-ended questions.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                Open\-ended questions\<\\/h4\>\\n\\n\\n\\nThese questions encourage respondents to write in free form. Allowing them to give their opinion or describe an experience in a few sentences.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n[Open\-ended questions\<\\/a\> are essential to qualitative research, as they enable researchers to explore and understand people\\u2019s motivations.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                Close\-ended questions\<\\/h4\>\\n\\n\\n\\n[Close\-ended questions\<\\/a\> are those that include all available answers within the question design.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nTypically, these take the form of multiple\-choice question types but can also include Likert scales, ratings, [Net Promoter Scores\<\\/a\> and rankings.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nThese question types are usually quantitative, as researchers can draw conclusions based on statistical analysis.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nThose conclusions can then be generalized and made representative of a wider population than was present in the survey sample.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                Write great survey questions\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is essential that your question wording is clear and concise to make the process as and smooth as possible for respondents.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nHere are a few more tips:\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                    \\n* Include all the context needed to answer in the question.\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                    * Only ask questions that are necessary for your research.\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                    * Ask one question at a time (no double\-barrelled questions).\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                    * Avoid emotionally loaded words and phrases.\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                    * Don\\u2019t use jargon or technical terms.\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                    * Don\\u2019t write leading questions.\<\\/li\>\\n\<\\/ul\>\\n\\n\\n\\nAs you can see, it’s incredibly important to know how to [write good survey questions\<\\/a\>.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                        Use the correct question types\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\nWhatever research method you\\u2019re using, you can take advantage of a range of [question types\<\\/a\> in your survey.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

This will take them straight to your questions.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                        Email surveys\<\\/h4\>\\n\\n\\n\\nYou may have access to an email list of respondents to distribute your survey to. This is an effective delivery method for customer and employee surveys, where you\\u2019ll already have access to a list.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nBut if you don\\u2019t already have one, it can be difficult to source an entirely new contact list. Especially since you\\u2019ll now have to collect consent to email participants.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nWith Shout, you can craft beautiful [email invitations for your surveys\<\\/a\>.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

And also, the average impressions your posts tend to receive.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nThe downside is that you can\\u2019t control who submits a response, so isn\\u2019t the best option for those looking for a targeted audience.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                        Embedding on your website\<\\/h4\>\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen it comes to collecting responses, web surveys are a little less effort than other forms of distribution.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nYou\\u2019ll simply use a short snippet of code to embed the survey on a web page, which you can link to or allow respondents to find it organically.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                        Purchasing a survey sample\<\\/h4\>\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you don\\u2019t have time to source your audience, you should consider purchasing a survey audience.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nThis method also allows you to select specific criteria for targeting respondents. \<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nFor example:\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                                \\n* Location\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
