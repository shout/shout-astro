Net Promoter Score FAQs
-----------------------

Everything you need to know about Net Promoter Score surveys and how they can help you measure customer loyalty.

**\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

#### What is Net Promoter Score?**

Net Promoter Score is the standard for measuring customer loyalty, by asking a single question.

**What is the NPS question?**

“On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend us to a friend or colleague?“.

This rating should be taken after a customer’s most recent interaction with you to measure their overall brand sentiment against that touch\-point. For example, after purchasing a product or service or interacting with your customer support team.

You should also consider asking some [open\-ended questions](https://shout.com/survey-design/open-ended-questions/) in the survey. This will provide some insight on how to improve customer ratings in the next run.

**\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

#### How is Net Promoter Score calculated?**

To calculate your Net Promoter Score, you must first discern the percentage total for each customer group (Detractors, Passives and Promoters).

Then subtract the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters. The number you’re left with is your NPS.

**Net Promoter Score Formula**

Promoters % – Detractors % \= NPS

If you conduct NPS surveys with Shout, we’ll calculate this for you in your results.

You can also use our [NPS calculator](https://shout.com/nps-calculator/), completely for free.

**\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

#### How are NPS respondents categorized?**

Customer ratings are split into three groups, based on what rating they choose for your NPS question (0\-10\):

* 0\- 6 \= Detractors
* 7 – 8 \= Passives
* 9 – 10 \= Promoters

Promoters are the advocates for your business, those who’re most likely to recommend you to a friend or colleague.

Passives are on the fence, they like your products or services but don’t have a big reason to share them with others.

Detractors are customers at risk of churning, possibly due to negative experiences with your business. It’s important that you reach out to these customers to find out how you can repair those relationships and turn them into promoters.

It’s important that NPS surveys are sent to both happy customers and unhappy customers. This will ensure there is no bias in your results, and your score isn’t artificial.

**\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

#### How to analyze NPS data**

Your NPS score will be somewhere between \-100 and \+100\. Generally, any score above 0 is considered good, so if you’re above this then you’re doing things right. Anything above 20 is great, and a score above 50 is excellent.

NPS surveys should be run regularly to measure change over time. You should also benchmark against industry competitors for context.

Once you’ve calculated your score, it’s time to use the open feedback you collected to find out how to can improve customer experiences.
