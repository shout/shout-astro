Teams FAQs
----------

**#### What’s the difference between admin users and team users?

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]**

Admin users are the primary user for your Shout team, they’re responsible for:

• Managing subscriptions and billing  
• Taking ownership of data collected by team users  
• Inviting and managing team user accounts

Depending on the plan you’re subscribed to, Admin’s will be able to access team user accounts from their own accounts in the app.

Team users are those invited by admins to join their Shout team. All features of the admin’s plan are accessible to team users from the word go.

Projects (surveys, quizzes, and forms) can be shared between all your team members to collaborate on building and analysis.

**#### Will my team members be able to see my surveys?

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]**

By default, all user accounts are private. So, no one will be able to see your surveys or data until they are shared via the collaboration features.

Access can be revoked to projects at any time.

**#### How many team users can I have?

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]**

The number of team users you’ll be able to invite to your Shout team is dependent on the plan you subscribe to:

The Research plan is intended for individuals, so doesn’t come with any team users as standard.

The Marketing plan comes with 3 users (1 admin and 2 team users).

The Compliance plan comes with 5 users (1 admin and 4 team users) or 10 users (1 admin and 9 team users).

The Enterprise plan can be configured for 10 users or more, get in touch for a custom quote.

**#### Are team users limited in any way?

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]**

Not at all!

Team users aren’t treated any differently in the app. You’ll have access to all the features and tools available to your admin and will be able to create as many projects as your heart desires.
