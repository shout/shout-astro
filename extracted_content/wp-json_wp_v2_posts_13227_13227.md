Open\-ended and closed\-ended questions are two different types of questions that are used in surveys and research. The main difference between the two is the type of response they elicit.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

So, let’s get right into open\-ended vs. closed\-ended questions.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

Open\-ended questions\<\\/h2\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
------------------------------------------

[Open\-ended questions\<\\/a\> allow respondents to provide a free\-form answer, meaning that they can respond in their own words.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

These types of questions are used to gather qualitative data, as they allow for a more in\-depth and detailed understanding of the respondent’s thoughts and opinions.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

However, open feedback can be time\-consuming to analyze, and the responses may be more difficult to compare across respondents.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

### Examples of open\-ended questions\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

Examples of open\-ended questions include:\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

\\n

2. How would you improve our product\\/ service?\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
3. Can you tell me about a difficult experience you’ve had and how you overcame it?\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
4. How do you see the future of this industry?\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
5. What do you think are the most important qualities for success in this field?\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
6. Can you describe a time when you had to work with a difficult team member?\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
7. In your opinion, what are some of the major challenges facing society today?\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
8. How do you manage stress and stay motivated in your work?\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
9. Can you tell me about a particularly meaningful project you have worked on?\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
10. In your opinion, what are the key factors that contribute to a successful business?\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
11. How do you approach problem\-solving and decision\-making in your work?\<\\/li\>\\n\<\\/ol\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    When it comes to choosing a [question type\<\\/a\> for open\-ended questions, you’ll likely need to use one of the below:\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    \\n

        * [Text box\<\\/a\>\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
            * [Text boxes (Multiple)\<\\/a\>\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
            * [Comment\\/ Essay Box\<\\/a\>\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
            * [Contact Forms\<\\/a\>\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
            * [Picture comments\<\\/a\>\<\\/li\>\\n\<\\/ul\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
            Closed\-ended questions\<\\/h2\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                            --------------------------------------------
            [Closed\-ended questions\<\\/a\> require a one word answer, such as a yes or no, or a selection from a predefined list of options.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
            These types of questions [collect quantitative data\<\\/a\>, as they allow for easy comparison and analysis.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
            One advantage of closed\-ended questions is that they are quick and easy to answer, and they can be used to gather a large amount of data in a short period of time. They are also useful for comparing responses across a large sample of respondents.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
            There are lots of question types you can use when asking closed\-ended questions in surveys, including:\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
            \\n

                                    Here are some usable examples of closed\-ended questions:\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                    \\n

                                                                                2. How old are you?\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                3. What is your gender?\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

                                                                                11. On what date will you be attending the event?\<\\/li\>\\n\<\\/ol\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

                                                                                    This provides a more well\-rounded understanding of the research topic, as the quantitative data from closed\-ended questions compliments the [qualitative data\<\\/a\> from open\-ended questions.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
