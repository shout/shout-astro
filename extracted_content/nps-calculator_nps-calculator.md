NPS CALCULATOR
==============

Calculate your Net Promoter Score
---------------------------------

Measure customer loyalty to identify your biggest fans with Shout’s free NPS calculator.

HOW TO USE THE NPS CALCULATOR

Start with a NPS survey
-----------------------

Create a survey with a scaled question (ranging from 0 to 10\) that asks customers how likely they are to recommend your business to their friends or colleagues. Then input your total number of Detractors (0 to 6\), Passives (7 and 8\) and Promoters (9 and 10\) into the calculator. Or create a [NPS survey](https://shout.com/nps-surveys/) with Shout, and we’ll calculate your NPS score for you.

NPS Calculator FAQs
-------------------

Everything you need to know about Net Promoter Score and how to calculate NPS.

### What is Net Promoter Score?

Net Promoter Score (NPS) is the scale by which businesses measure customer loyalty to their brand, products, or services.

NPS surveys only require you to ask a single question: “How likely are you to recommend \[Brand / Product / Service] to a friend or colleague?”

### What is the formula for NPS?

NPS is calculated by subtracting the total percentage of detractors from the total percentage of promoters.

NPS formula \= Promoters % – Detractors %

To calculate what percentage of your respondents promoters make up, you can use the below formula:

Promoters percentage formula: Promoters / (Promoters \+ Passives \+ Detractors) \* 100

You can then repeat this for Detractors (and Passives, if you wish) to determine the percentage they represent.

However, if you use our NPS calculator above, you’ll only need to enter your number of Promoters, Passives and Detractors. We’ll calculate the percentages they represent and calculate your NPS score for you.

### How are NPS responses categorized?

Respondents select from a scale of 0 (Not at all likely) to 10 (Extremely likely), and are split into three categories based on their rating:

**Promoters (9\-10\)**: These are your happiest customers, who act as advocates for your business.

**Passives (7\-8\)**: These are fans of your business but aren’t yet motivated to advocate for you.

**Detractors (0\-6\)**: These customers are generally unhappy with your business due to poor customer experiences.

Identifying the percentage of customers in each category allows you to calculate your Net Promoter Score.

### What is a good NPS score?

NPS can range from \-100 to \+100, with a higher score indicating a more positive perception of your brand.

Anything between 0\-20 is good, 21\-50 is very good, 51\-80 is excellent, and above 80 is word class!

### How do I increase my Net Promoter Score?

To increase your NPS, you’ll need to identify what frictions are impacting customer experiences. Running an NPS survey that also collect open feedback about why customers choose their score is by far the most efficient way to do this.

You should also open a line of communication with your Detractors to resolve any existing issues and ask for any other feedback they may have about your product or service.

Then run another NPS survey after about 6 months to measure the success of the changes you made. This should result in a higher Net Promoter Score for your business.
