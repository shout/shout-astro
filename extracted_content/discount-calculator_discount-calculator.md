DISCOUNT CALCULATOR
===================

Calculate discount as a %
-------------------------

Calculate the discount percentage for a product or service, based on the original and final price.

HOW TO USE THE DISCOUNT CALCULATOR

Enter original and final price
------------------------------

Simply enter the original price (before discount) and the final price (after discount), and we’ll calculate the discount applied to the product or service, expressed as a percentage.

Discount Calculator FAQs
------------------------

Everything you need to know about discounts and our online discount calculator.

### What is a discount?

Discounts are a reduction in the price of a product or service. Common types of discounts are percentage discounts (e.g. 10% off), fixed amount discounts (e.g. $20 off), or special promotions like buy\-one\-get\-one\-free (BOGO) offers.

They’re often seen in sales promotions, clearance events, seasonal discounts, and loyalty programs. For example, a store might offer a 25% discount on all winter clothing at the end of the season to clear out inventory and make room for new items.

### How does the discount calculator work?

Shout’s discount calculator is very simple. Just enter the original price of a product or service and then the discounted price, and we’ll calculate the discount this reduction represents.

So, if your original price was $50 and the discounted price is $40, this would be a discount of 20%.

### What is the discount formula?

The formula for calculating a discount is easy, simply subtract the final price from the original price, divide that by the original price, and multiply that by 100\. This will leave you with a value expressed as a percentage.

Discount formula \= (Original Price – Final Price) / Original Price \* 100

### What is a good CSAT score?

To calculate the original price using the discount percentage and the discounted price, you can rearrange the formula for calculating the discounted price. Here’s the formula:

Original price \= Final Price / 1 – (Discount Percentage / 100\)

Here are the individual steps for this formula:

1. Divide the discount percentage by 100 to express it as a fraction.
2. Subtract the fraction from 1\.
3. Divide the final price by this value.

For example, let’s say that the final sale price of a product was $68, with a 20% discount on the original price.

1. 20 / 100 \= 0\.2
2. 1 – 0\.2 \= 0\.8
3. 68 / 0\.8 \= 85

And there we go, the original price of this product is $85\.
