    What are multiple responses?\<\\/h2\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
            -------------------------------------------------

    In this case \\u2018multiple responses\\u2019 does not refer to multiple choice questions. It concerns the ability to submit more than one response using a single device (PC, Laptop, Tablet, Phone).\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    When [creating a survey\<\\/a\> with Shout, we call these Duplicate Responses.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    ### Pros of allowing duplicate responses\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    There\\u2019s a good reason that you may want to do this. Where devices are shared (in spaces such as offices and classrooms), it is more than likely that multiple people will be using the same device at different times.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    If you don\\u2019t allow multiple responses, it becomes a first\-come first\-serve scenario. This restricts access to your project and means your results\\/ respondent pool will shrink.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    ### Cons\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    By allowing the same device to submit more than one response can result have to negative outcomes.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    \\n
                + A respondent submits the same set of responses repeatedly. Giving their opinion too much weight in your results.\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                + They submit a different set of results each time, skewing your data altogether.\<\\/li\>\\n\<\\/ul\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                    Should you allow multiple responses?\<\\/h2\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                    ---------------------------------------------------------
                    Ensuring the integrity of your results is the most important aspect of data collection. So, your decision should be based on which option incurs less risk for your project.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                    If you\\u2019re running a [customer satisfaction survey\<\\/a\> on a kiosk in\-store, then you\\u2019ll need to allow that device to submit more than once response.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                    But if you\\u2019re emailing your survey, your contact can respond via mobile. Meaning, your response rate shouldn\\u2019t be affected.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                    How it works with Shout\<\\/h2\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        --------------------------------------------
                    We prevent multiple responses by storing the survey ID on the respondent\\u2019s device when they\\u2019ve submitted a response.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                    If they attempt to respond again from the same device, they would be informed that they\\u2019ve already completed the survey.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                    ### How to disable multiple responses\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                    By default, respondents will be able to complete your project multiple times. To disable this feature, follow the steps below:\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                    \\n
                    2. Open a Survey\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                            3. Click \\u2018Settings\\u2019 in the sidebar\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                            4. Toggle the switch under \\u2018Prevent Duplicate Responses\\u2019\<\\/li\>\\n\<\\/ol\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                    A respondent\\u2019s device will now only be able to submit one response to your project.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                    We offer many advanced [survey features\<\\/a\> like this on Shout, and we’re always open to your recommendations for more.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
