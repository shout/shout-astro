            The RACE model is a framework for the strategic planning of digital marketing activities or omnichannel communication plans.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
            The model consists of four stages, each aimed at customers in a different stage of the customer lifecycle, with the aim of building relationships and increasing customer loyalty.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
            It was developed by Dave Cheffey, from [Smart Insights\<\\/a\>, to help marketers integrate digital marketing with more traditional marketing activities.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

                                ----------------------------------------------
            RACE is an acronym formed of the four stages of a marketing framework. These stages are Reach, Act, Convert, Engage.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
            Each stage is its own ongoing process, but all aim to move leads down the pipeline to eventually become advocates of your business or brand.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
            However, there is a stage prior to any of the others: Plan.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
            ### Plan\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
            It\\u2019s essential that you begin your digital marketing strategy by planning and setting goals. Your strategy is liable to change the longer it is in place, and that\\u2019s a good thing, but when you\\u2019re starting out you do want to make sure your goals are SMART.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
            If you\\u2019ve not heard that term before, SMART is a way of setting goals for campaigns and projects that are trackable and set a foundation for success.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
            Each letter is SMART stands for something that can help you set these kinds of goals:\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
            \\n
                                    - **S\<\\/span\>\<\\/strong\>pecific\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                        - **M\<\\/span\>\<\\/strong\>easurable\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                        - **A\<\\/span\>\<\\/strong\>chievable\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                        - **R\<\\/span\>\<\\/strong\>elevant\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                        - **T\<\\/span\>\<\\/strong\>ime\-bound\<\\/li\>\\n\<\\/ul\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                        ### Reach\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                        In the Reach stage, your aim will be to generate exposure for your brand, product or services using both online and offline media.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                        You can measure the success of your efforts by tracking the traffic generated by your campaigns to your website or social media pages.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                        This stage of the RACE model is hugely important when [launching a new website\<\\/a\> or product, as early exposure will lead to a higher return on investment.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                        You might be stuck for ideas on how to increase your reach. Well, you can do this by utilizing your earned, paid and owned media.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
