            What are trap questions?\<\\/h2\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                ---------------------------------------------
            Trap questions are used in surveys as attention checks to identify respondents who aren\\u2019t answering honestly.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
            Survey creators give respondents a choice of answer options, where only one is correct.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
            These questions should be easy for a respondent to answer, as they\\u2019re only verifying that they\\u2019re paying attention. They aren\\u2019t meant to test a respondent\\u2019s knowledge.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
            Multiple\-Choice [question types\<\\/a\> are most commonly used for trap questions. These are simpler than other types and give respondents the best chance to choose the correct answer.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
            They\\u2019re also referred to as \\u2018Red Herring\\u2019 questions, Attention Checks, and Instructional Manipulation Checks (ICMs).\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
            ### Trap question example\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Example\<\\/figure\>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2018Lettuce\\u2019 (C) is the correct answer here. And so, you\\u2019d be able to identify respondents who aren\\u2019t paying attention. You\\u2019d have to take into account any international respondents, as not all questions will translate well.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nIn these cases, you could create a more obvious trap. For example:\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nSelect D as your answer choice\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                    \\n- A\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                    - B\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                    - C\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                    - D\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                    - E\<\\/li\>\\n\<\\/ul\>\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, there are several risks in using traps, which we\\u2019ll address a bit further down.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                        Do I need a trap question in my survey?\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\nTrap questions can be useful as a control method if you\\u2019re sharing your survey with a general audience when you can\\u2019t be sure all responses are genuine.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nThey\\u2019re also useful if you\\u2019re offering [incentives for survey responses\<\\/a\>. In these cases, some respondents may only complete your survey for a chance at receiving the \\u2018prize\\u2019\.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd so the trap acts as an attention check to ensure respondents are considering each question.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                        When buying survey respondents\<\\/h4\>\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you’re [purchasing survey respondents\<\\/a\> using Shout audience you won’t need a trap question, as our respondent panels are vetted and profiled for you.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                        Ways dishonest respondents disengage from surveys\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                            \\n* **Primary Answer Selection\<\\/b\>: They choose the first answer listed each time.\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n* **Positive Answer Choices (Acquiescence Response Bias)\<\\/b\>: They select the positive answers for each question (e.g. \\u2018yes\\u2019, \\u2018strongly agree\\u2019\).\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n* **Neutral Answer Choices\<\\/b\>: They only pick neutral answers, such as \\u2018Don\\u2019t Know\\u2019, \\u2018N\\/A\\u2019, or \\u2018No Opinion\\u2019 for each question.\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n* **Straight Lining\<\\/b\>: They choose the same point for every scale (e.g. answer A).\<\\/li\>\\n\<\\/ul\>\\n\\n\\n\\n**The above examples are all [types of response bias\<\\/a\>, which can be a result of dishonest respondents.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                How can disengagement impact your results?\<\\/h4\>\\n\\n\\n\\nThe data that disengaged respondents provide are not honest or accurate. Meaning, your research findings won\\u2019t be representative of your target population.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                How to add a trap question\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\nAs we mentioned above, trap questions are usually multiple\-choice questions, where respondents must pick a single answer.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you\\u2019re creating a survey with Shout, you can follow the steps below to add a trap.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                \\n+ Drag and drop a Multiple Choice (Single\-Select) into your survey\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                + Add a few answer options (4 \\u2013 6 should be enough)\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                + Apply Page Logic to the incorrect answers and point them to a disqualification page.\<\\/li\>\\n\<\\/ul\>\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can do this without using Logic, but the alternative is to filter your results by those who picked the wrong answer, then removing those responses.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nAlthough, you could also [create a separate report\<\\/a\> for those who didn\\u2019t fall for your trap question. This method allows you to keep all your responses.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                    Risks of using ‘red herring’ questions\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\nAlthough these \\u2018red herring questions\\u2019 intend to identify disengaged or dishonest respondents, there\\u2019s also a chance they\\u2019ll cause problems in your surveys.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                        \\n- Respondents may lose trust in you.\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                        - Honest respondents may choose the wrong answer by accident\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                        - Dishonest respondents may choose the correct answer\<\\/li\>\\n\<\\/ul\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                            Damaging relationships\<\\/h4\>\\n\\n\\n\\nRegardless of whether or not the respondent is genuine, they may disengage from your survey if they realize you\\u2019re trying to trap them. As a trap question exhibits a lack of trust.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nThis may result in losing respondents from your survey and a reluctance to participate in any future research projects.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                            Losing honest respondents\<\\/h4\>\\n\\n\\n\\nHonest respondents (those who\\u2019re qualified to respond) may choose the red herring answer by accident.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd so they\\u2019ll be removed from your survey and you\\u2019ll lose valuable data.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                            Failed trap questions\<\\/h4\>\\n\\n\\n\\nConversely to the above, dishonest respondents may choose the correct answer.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nMeaning your trap is failed and your results are at risk of being skewed.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                            Best practice for trap questions\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\nThe biggest risk of using trap questions is causing respondents to lose trust and alienating them.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n**You can minimise this by placing a more obvious trap question at the beginning of your survey.\<\\/b\>\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n**This will act as more of a screening question rather than as an explicit trap. This will be a signal to respondents that you are just doing your due diligence, rather than showing a lack of trust.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nAnswer dishonesty usually occurs because the survey is too long, too complex, or offering an incentive.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\nTake a look at[how to conduct survey research\<\\/a\> or the](\"https:\/\/wp-stagesh.bugfree.co.uk\/survey-design\/how-to-conduct-survey-research\/\") [survey design best \<\\/a\>](\"https:\/\/wp-stagesh.bugfree.co.uk\/email-marketing\/best-practices-for-email-subject-lines\/\")[p\<\\/a\>](\"https:\/\/wp-stagesh.bugfree.co.uk\/survey-design\/survey-design-best-practices\/\")[ractices\<\\/a\>.\<\\/p\>\\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"What are trap questions?
