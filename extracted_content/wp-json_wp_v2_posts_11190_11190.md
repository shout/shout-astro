                                                    Building your email list organically is key to your strategy as then you know you are targeting those who are actually interested in what you have to offer. You need to generate leads through people signing up and subscribing to your email list.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    If you have to do this and you opt for cold outreach then you risk alienating consumers and ending up being marked as spam.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    If you’re struggling to build your audience, take a look at this lead of [lead magnets\<\\/a\> to help you grow your email list.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    ### 3\. Segment email lists to track referrals\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    Segmentation will allow you to focus on sending out more emails to people who are more likely to convert into paying customers.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    For example, you could create a segment based on contacts who open or click above 80% of the time. Targeting your most engaged contacts will ensure a higher conversion rate for your affiliate email marketing campaigns.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    With Shout, it’s simple to [segment your contacts\<\\/a\> based on email metrics, contact information, and even survey data.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    ### 4\. Write relevant content\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    Some affiliates have built up a huge subscriber base and generate significant revenue from regularly sending follow\-up emails to their subscribers. The key here is to get to [know your audience\<\\/a\> and then to offer valuable content through your affiliate dashboard and give your subscribers something useful.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    Your subscribers signed up for your email list because they want information from you. Therefore, your affiliate email marketing campaigns should provide value first and promote affiliate links second. This is the only way to truly build trust with your audience and increase conversion in the future.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    ### 5\. Keep your affiliate marketing goal in mind when crafting an email\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    Make sure to keep your end goal in mind when drafting your emails. Are you trying to get a user to subscribe, purchase something, or make a return visit?\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    Once you know your goal for each email, keep it in mind when writing a copy. Every email should include a link back to your site so readers can accomplish that action and then convert into paying customers.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    ### 6\. Do not hard sell or spam\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    Hard sell means directly pressuring your prospects to buy your product or service with coercive tactics. Emails should not be vehicles for blatant salesmanship. Instead, they should give valuable information in exchange for your audience’s fair amount of trust and goodwill.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    Spamming people is also a bad form. You don’t want to fill someone’s inbox with unwanted emails just because you can.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    ### 7\. Use the right type of emails\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    People are more likely to open an email and click on links in emails sent from companies they trust and recognize. Some of the most common types of emails include:\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                    \\n
                                                                                                                + [Welcome emails\<\\/a\> \\u2013 used to welcome new subscribers to your list.\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                                                    + Sales\\/promotional emails \\u2013 used to promote your favorite products or services.\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                                                    + Relationship\-building emails \\u2013 are used to build a rapport with your subscribers.\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                                                    + Educational emails \\u2013 are used to educate your subscribers about a particular topic and provide them with information.\<\\/li\>\\n\<\\/ul\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                                                    You must utilize the affiliate marketing emails relevant to your niche and situation to boost your affiliate commission. Whichever type of email you choose, always make sure that you personalize it as much as possible. Personalized emails have a higher chance of being opened.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                                                    ### 8\. Automate your promotional email sequence\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                                                    Most people do affiliate email marketing manually, so you have to spend time drafting and sending content emails. Instead of doing that, consider automating your promotional emails.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                                                    Doing so will help you promote your content more efficiently and allow you to earn more and scale as needed. Many tools are available for automation, so be sure to utilize them.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                                                    ### 9\. Naturally include multiple affiliate links\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                                                    It’s tempting to include just one or two affiliate links but have at least five in every post you write. The more you naturally include affiliate links, especially ones that point to high commission products and categories, will help boost your affiliate income. Ensure that these links are relevant to your readers and offer value.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                                                    This applies to when you’re directing contacts to a landing page or blog post that, you don’t want to fill your email content with a bunch of links. This will appear spammy to contacts and email senders.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                                                    Creating content outside of emails allows you to share it across other platforms, such as social media.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                                                    ### 10\. Cover the entire buyer journey\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

Be sure that your emails cover their [entire journey as a customer\<\\/a\> and includes everything a buyer needs to make a purchase.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                                                    When making a purchase there are three stages a buyer goes through; awareness, consideration and decision.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

                                                                                                                    ### 12\. Highlight the product featured\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

Just keep track of how many sales each campaign generates, so you know which ones are worth repeating.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                                                    ### 14\. Monitor your affiliate related insights \& trends\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
