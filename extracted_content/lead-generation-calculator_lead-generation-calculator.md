HOW TO USE THE LEAD GENERATION CALCULATOR

Lead Generation Calculator FAQs
-------------------------------

We answer some of the most frequently asked questions to help you meet your lead goals and revenue targets.

### How do you calculate lead generation rate?

Your lead generation rate is calculated by dividing your number of website visitors by the number of leads you generated, then multiplying that by 100\.

Lead Generation Rate \= (Number of leads generated / Number of website visitors) \* 100

### How do you calculate how many leads and customers you need?

If you need to calculate how many leads you’ll need to meet your revenue goals, you’ll need to divide your current monthly average customer revenue by your new revenue goal, then multiple that by your lead generation rate.

New Leads Needed \= New monthly revenue goal / Average customer revenue monthly) \* Lead generation rate

### How do you calculate what a lead is worth?

To calculate the value of leads (for your business specifically), you’ll need to take the total revenue you’ve generated from leads and divide this by the number of leads you’ve generated.

Lead Value \= Total revenue generated / Number of leads

### How do you measure lead generation as a KPI?

There are many KPIs you can track as part of your lead generation campaigns, let’s get into a few of those below:

Number of leads generated: Track how many leads were generated over a specific period of time.

Lead conversion rate: Calculate the total number of leads that were converted into paying customers.

LCR formula: (Number of conversions / Number of leads) \* 100

Cost per lead: Calculate the average cost per individual lead.

CPL formula: Total cost of lead generation campaign / Number of leads generated
