Compliant CRM functionality, for all plans
------------------------------------------

All our plans come with CRM functionality, enabling you to store and manage your contact with ease. Shout CRM was built with compliance in mind, so we’ve included robust features to ensure everything you do complies with the GDPR, UK\-GDPR, and CCPA.

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

##### Grow your contact lists

Import your contacts to the CRM, group them based on any criteria, and segment audiences to send targeted campaigns.

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

##### Track your basis for data processing

Assign contact groups a lawful basis for processing data, such as Legitimate Interests, Contract, or Consent.

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

##### Collect and record explicit consent

Connect forms to consent groups, and we’ll add a question that collects explicit consent and records it to contact profiles in the CRM.

Team enabled plans and features
-------------------------------

Plans bundled with team users allow you to invite your colleagues to join your Shout team. Each user will have access to their own account, and all surveys are private by default.

Billing is centralized, and data ownership is consolidated under the admin account. Meaning, you don’t have to worry about who controls the data in a team user account if an employee leaves.

[Shout Teams](https://shout.com/teams/)

**#### Share the features of your plan

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]**

All users who’re part of your Shout team will be able to use the features and tools available with your plan.

**#### Collaborate on any project

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]**

Share your surveys, quizzes, and reports with your team users to collaborate on projects together.

When project is shared, it will appear in the dashboard of your chosen team member. You can revoke access to shared projects at any time.

**#### Admin controls

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]**

Team admins have control over billing and ownership of all data collected by their team.

As an admin, you’ll be able to access team user accounts, remove them from your Shout team, and purge all data in their account

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

**#### What is a team user?

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]**

Team users are those you invite to join your Shout team and share in the features of your plan. They will use their own credentials to log into their own accounts, so you don’t need to worry about them accessing your private surveys and data.

**#### How does the 14\-day free trial work?

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]**

When creating an account with Shout, you’ll automatically be put on the 14\-day free trial of our Pro plan. You’ll be able use all features included in that plan and run test surveys to get an idea of how your results will look.

You won’t need to enter any credit card details to get started, and you can cancel anytime.

At the end of your trial your account will be locked, but we’ll keep all your surveys and test data safe until you subscribe to a plan.

**#### Do you offer discounts for Non\-Profits?

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]**

Yes! We offer a 45% discount on the Pro plan for Non\-Profits.

**#### Are there email sending limits for each plan?

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]**

There is a limit applied to the number of monthly email invitations that can be sent with each plan:

• Essentials: 3000 emails per 30 rolling days.  
• Pro: 5000 emails per 30 rolling days.  
• Business: 7000 emails per 30 rolling days.

It’s not possible to exceed these limits, so you don’t have to worry about any sudden charges.

**#### How does the subscription service work?

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]**

Shout is a subscription\-based service, which means plans renew automatically at the end of your billing period (unless cancelled).

If you cancel part\-way through your subscription term, you will still retain features and access until the end of your original billing period. But your subscription will not renew again.
