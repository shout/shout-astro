Market Research FAQs
--------------------

Everything you need to know about market research surveys and how to collect data that improves business strategies and increases revenue.

**#### What is market research?

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]**

Market research is a process of acquiring information about consumer preferences, market trends, and buying patterns. It helps businesses understand what consumers want, how they want it, and how much they are willing to pay for it. It can help businesses develop new products and services, improve their marketing efforts, and determine the best way to price their products.

By understanding the market in which a business operates, market researchers can help companies make informed decisions about how to compete and grow.

**#### Why is market research important?

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]**

Whatever your target market is, trends and customer preferences are always changing. Even if you’ve gotten lucky with blind campaigns in the past, you can’t be sure they will in the long run.

Market research enables organizations to make business decisions without guesswork. Whether you’re developing a new product or creating a targeted ad campaign, this research provides actionable insights on how to ensure each project is as successful as the last.

Below, we’ve explored some of the ways you can use market research surveys to broaden your understanding of the marketplace, your customers and potential customers.

**#### How can market research help my business?

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]**

Below, we’ve explored some of the ways you can use market research surveys to broaden your understanding of the marketplace, your customers and potential customers.

* Understand your target market.
* Measure brand awareness and explore your brand identity.
* Product concept tests.
* Collect product and website feedback.
* Perform competitor research.
* Learn more about your existing customers.
* Identify frictions and pain\-points.

**#### What’s the difference between primary and secondary market research?

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]**

Primary market research involves collecting data straight from the subjects you’re studying (i.e., first\-party data). Market research surveys would fit into this category, as you’re sending your surveys directly to audiences to collect data.

Secondary market research used data from pre\-existing sources to inform your strategy, e.g., published research studies.

6 Tips for Market Research Surveys
----------------------------------

**\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

#### 1\. Set an objective for your research**

The first thing you need to decide is what you want to achieve with the market survey. Consider what problem you’re trying to solve or what element of your business you’re trying to improve.

**\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

#### 2\. Narrow your scope**

You don’t want to be over\-ambitious with the scope of your research. For example, if you’re setting out to measure your brand awareness, avoid asking questions about new product or services.

**\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

#### 3\. Only ask relevant questions**

This is a good rule for any survey. We understand the impulse to collect as much data as possible while you’ve got a respondent’s attention. But asking too much will lead to a low completion rate.

**\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

#### 4\. Write questions for a target audience**

You should have an ideal audience in mind to collect the right data and to inform a specific strategy. Write your questions with this audience in mind to optimize data collection and build better relationships.

**\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

#### 5\. Set a schedule for market research**

You’ll need to know when you’re sending your survey out, how many times you’ll send it and when you hope to collect all your data by. The best time to send a survey is between 9\-10 am or 2\-3 pm.

**\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

#### 6\. Run a pilot survey**

Running a test survey with a smaller sample size or focus group to identify questions that need to be tweaked to collect higher quality survey data. You can also determine if you’ve targeted the right audience.
