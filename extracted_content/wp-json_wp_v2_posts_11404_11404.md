The purpose of surveys is to get answers to important questions. For the most part, they’re used to find out what people think about a subject and why they feel that way about it.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

Surveys can come in many forms, depending on what you’re hoping to achieve by collecting data. But all surveys should have a goal or objective; a reason you’re collecting the data. Or more specifically, the problem you’re trying to solve with the data you collect.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

Your questions should be written to help you reach your goal, each collecting an answer that helps you solve a puzzle you find yourself faced with.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

They’re an extremely important business tool, as they not only allow you to identify your strengths and weaknesses but also to build strong relationships with your audience.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

                    --------------------------------------

    A survey is a method of collecting information from an audience with the aim of learning more about them. What you learn can be used to make better business decisions or inform research.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    The application of surveys is wide and can include; consumer behavior, market research, and political opinion.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    What’s the purpose of surveys?\<\\/h2\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                    ---------------------------------------------------

    Whilst each survey has its own goal, the purpose of surveys is to help you develop an understanding of your audience with the aim of informing decision\-making.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

                        + Market researchers use surveys to collect data on consumer behavior, product preferences, and industry trends to make better business decisions.\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        + Public opinion pollsters use surveys to gather information on political opinions, voting patterns, and public attitudes.\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        + Academics can use surveys to collect data that is vital to their research. Academics can also use surveys to test the validity of existing or old research by employing various [tools like construct validity\<\\/a\> on the acquired data.\<\\/li\>\\n\<\\/ul\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                            When creating a survey, you should ask yourself what you\\u2019re trying to achieve. This will be the goal of your survey.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                            Then, each of your survey questions should be tailored to help you meet that goal. This has two major benefits, firstly you\\u2019re only collecting the data you need, and secondly, your survey is concise (which is good for respondents).\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                            In some cases, surveys will have set questions that need to be asked to achieve that goal, e.g. [Net Promoter Score\<\\/a\>.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
