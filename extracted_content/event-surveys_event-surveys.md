Event Surveys FAQs
------------------

Everything you need to know about event surveys and how they can help you improve attendee experiences.

**#### What are event surveys?

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]**

Event surveys are tools used by event organizers to gather valuable feedback from event attendees, aiming to assess attendee satisfaction and gather insights that can be instrumental in enhancing the experience for future events.

These surveys typically incorporate a range of question types, including multiple\-choice, scales, and open\-ended questions, to capture diverse perspectives.

Event surveys serve as a conduit for event attendees to provide constructive feedback on various aspects such as venue, speakers, content, logistics, and overall satisfaction.

By understanding the preferences and concerns of attendees, event organizers can make informed decisions to improve future events, creating an environment that aligns with participant expectations.

Moreover, event surveys also play a crucial role in gauging the effectiveness of sponsorships, ensuring that sponsors receive valuable exposure and that their expectations are met.

**#### Why is event feedback important?

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]**

Event surveys can help you identify any problems that occurred during an event, learn about participants’ opinions and experiences, and measure how successful an event was. This information can help you improve future events and make sure they’re more enjoyable for everyone involved.

**#### What are the different types of surveys for event management?

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]**

There are three types of event surveys you’ll need to be aware of: pre\-event surveys, mid\-event surveys, and post\-event surveys.

**What are pre\-event surveys?**

There are two main functions to pre\-event surveys; to plan the details of your event and to learn as much as possible about your invitees. Then you can use this information to set KPIs and ensure the event meets the expectations of your guests.

**What are mid\-event surveys?**

Live feedback is essential to making your event a success. During a break, or between events, ask guests to provide some feedback on the event experience so far.

This allows you to measure satisfaction and address and make any off\-the\-cuff changes. Avoid sending out a mid\-event survey during the lunch break, as you’re likely to get a low response rate. You should give your attendees that time to rest and prepare for the next half of the event.

**What are post\-event surveys?**

Now your event is done, it’s time to highlight its successes and failures with constructive feedback. Get in touch with attendees to find out what they liked, what could use improvement and what didn’t meet their expectations.

This information is used to determine your even ROI, measure attendee satisfaction and inform the planning for your next event.

**#### What are some examples of event survey questions?

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]**

Here are some examples of the types of questions for your event surveys:

* Which talks did you attend?  
*Multiple\-choice question*
* Would you recommend this event to a friend or colleague? (Employee NPS)  
*NPS question*
* How would you improve the event?  
*Text question*
* Have you attended this event before?  
*Binary question*
* Did you have enough time for networking opportunities?  
*Matrix question*
* How helpful were event staff?  
*Opinion scale*
* Are you likely to participate in this event in the future?  
*Matrix question*
* What did you enjoy most about the event?  
*Text question*
* How did you find out about the event?  
*Multiple\-choice question*
* Were you happy with the time you had for questions?  
*Matrix question*
* Did the event meet your expectations?  
*Binary question*
* How satisfied are you with the event overall?  
*Matrix question*

A lot of the above are post event survey questions, but with some small changes they can be used mid event or even before an event occurs.
