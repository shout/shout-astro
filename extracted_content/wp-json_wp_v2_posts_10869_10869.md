                            -----------------------------------

    The range of [question types\<\\/a\> offered by survey tools can highlight how flexible that tool is for users. The more types that are offered, the wider range of surveys, quizzes, and forms you can create.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    ### Shout\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    You can choose from 23 question types, including:\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

Type your question text into the [question prediction field\<\\/a\> (which is included in all surveys by default), and a question type will be assigned automatically. \<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

Well, it’s everything from how your raw data is presented to you, the tools you have at your disposal to identify patterns in that data, and methods of presenting that data in a professional way.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                    ### Shout\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

                                                                                    You can then set a filter to show responses based on the answer chosen by respondents. Allowing you to create and save separate reports for each of these categories.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                    You can also compare data based on answer choices. Using the same example as above, you could compare 360 feedback between two or more of those categories.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

                                                                                                -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                                    As we’ve outlined above, you can see there’s a fair share of differences between Google Forms and Shout.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                    Shout is a robust tools with a wide array of features intended to make creating surveys, quizzes, and forms as easy as possible.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                    Google Forms does offer basic survey creation tools for free, but you have less choice when it comes to customization, collecting responses, and analyzing results.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                    ### What else does Shout offer?\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                    We’ve integrated state of the art email marketing features, which you can use to create survey invitations and send survey invitations with more customization than you’ll find anywhere else.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                    When an email invitation has been linked to a survey, your [email metrics\<\\/a\> are merged with your survey data into a single professional report. You also have the unprecedented ability to filter and compare data within your report based on both surveys and emails.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
 **Why is this useful?\<\\/b\>\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n**
                                                                                    Say you’ve sent your surveys to a number of groups. You can filter and compare survey data for each of these groups.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
 **Not impressed yet?\<\\/b\>\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n**
                                                                                    You can also identify your most engaged customers (those with the highest open rates) and compare their feedback with your least engaged.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
 **Still not impressed?\<\\/b\>\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n**
                                                                                    How about if you could create contact groups by segmenting based on their feedback? This would allow you to find out what’s most important to your audience (whether it’s content or products) and group them accordingly.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                    By doing so, you’re able to send more targeted email campaigns to these groups, which will increase your open rates and build better relationships.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
