Our Mission
-----------

Having roots firmly placed in research and feedback, we know that listening to the people you matter most to your business is the only way to grow. But, with the growing number of data protection regulations around the world, collecting data isn’t as simple as it once was. That’s why we’ve re\-built our software from the ground up, to make data collection as compliant as possible and remove some of that risk for businesses.
