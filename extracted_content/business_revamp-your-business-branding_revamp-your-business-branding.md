The power of strong business branding: a true story
---------------------------------------------------

In 2013, Airbnb was struggling to gain traction in the market. They were losing money and struggling to attract customers. However, they decided to revamp their branding strategy, which paid off.

They realized their old logo design was outdated and did not reflect the company’s values. So they hired a design agency and created a new brand logo representing their values and vision.

They also created a new slogan, “Belong Anywhere,” which reflected their commitment to providing unique travel experiences to their customers.

The results were outstanding. In just a few months, Airbnb’s bookings increased by 30%, and they gained millions of new customers.

Tips for revamping your business branding
-----------------------------------------

The power of branding your business cannot be overstated, and the right branding strategy can transform your business.

So, let’s get into some of our top tips for revamping your business branding in 2023:

### Create an identity to make a lasting impression

Creating a strong brand identity is the first step to revamping your[digital marketing business branding](https://shout.com/digital-marketing/digital-marketing-strategies-for-small-business/). A strong brand identity will help your business stand out and make a lasting impression on your customers.

You must define your brand story, values, and mission to create a strong identity. Your brand values should reflect your business’s core beliefs and principles, while your mission statement should reflect your business’s purpose.

Once you have defined your brand values and mission, you must create a brand voice. Your brand voice should reflect the personality of your target audience and should be consistent across all your marketing channels.

### How to find your target audience

Your target audience will be comprised of your ideal customers, these are the people that you’ve created your product/ service for.

To identify your target audience, you’ll need to [conduct market research](https://shout.com/market-research-surveys/). This will consist of a mix of communicating with prospective customers, building buyer personas, and competitor research.

You should also collect feedback from your existing customer base, most importantly your loyal customers. These can give you essential insight into what your business does well and why they have remained loyal to you.

You can even make this a win\-win situation, by asking [testimonial questions](https://freeonlinesurveys.com/customer-surveys/testimonial-questions) to collect feedback on your business and generate social proof.

It’s very simple to identify your most loyal customers, simply conduct a [Net Promoter Score survey](https://shout.com/nps-surveys/) to measure customer loyalty. Those who score you a 9 or 10 on the scale are considered promoters, who are your biggest advocates.

### Use visuals to your advantage

Visuals are a powerful tool for[branding](https://www.entrepreneur.com/encyclopedia/branding). They can help your business create a memorable and lasting impression on your customers.

You need to be consistent across all your marketing channels when using visuals. Your visuals should reflect your brand values and personality and be unique to your business.

Some of the visuals you can use for branding include:

* your logo
* website design
* social media graphics
* marketing materials

Ensure your visuals are high\-quality, appealing, and consistent across all channels.

### Leverage social media

Social media is an essential tool for digital marketing branding. It is a cost\-effective way to reach a vast audience and build brand awareness. You must create a[social media strategy](https://hbr.org/2016/03/branding-in-the-age-of-social-media) reflecting your brand values and personality.

When using social media, ensure consistency in your messaging and visuals. Use hashtags and keywords to increase your visibility and engage with your audience.

Social media can help you build a loyal fan base, increase brand recognition, and even meet potential customers.

### Develop a name

Your business name is an essential aspect of your branding strategy. It ought to be easy to remember, distinct, and memorable all at the same time.

In addition, your business name should reflect your brand values and personality and be relevant to your industry.

#### Here are some name ideas for 2023 that reflect modern branding trends:

* **Enigma** – unique, memorable, and mysterious, making it perfect for businesses that offer innovative solutions.
* **Spectra** – reflects the diversity of the modern world, making it ideal for businesses that celebrate being inclusive.
* **Ora** – short and easy to remember, great for businesses that want to create a strong brand identity.
* **Vantage** – highlights a sense of ambition, innovation, and a forward\-thinking approach.
* **Luminous** – a sense of creativity and enlightenment, showcases a unique approach to problem\-solving.

When choosing a business name, ensure it is not already used and is easy to spell and pronounce. Make sure you can register a domain name using your company’s name.[Consider a high\-end domain](https://www.squadhelp.com/premium-domains-for-sale)to avoid legal issues.

### Focus on customer experience

Finally, you must focus on customer experience to revamp your[digital marketing business](https://shout.com/digital-marketing/digital-marketing-strategies-for-small-business/)branding. The customer experience is an essential aspect of branding, and it can make or break your business.

To create a great customer experience, you need to understand your customers’ needs and preferences. Then, you must develop products and services that meet their needs and provide exceptional customer service.

You can also leverage technology to [improve customer experience](https://shout.com/customer-experience/measuring-and-improving-customer-experience/). For example, you can use chatbots and AI\-powered customer service tools to provide quick and personalized responses to your customers.

Revamp your business branding in 2023: wrapping up

By creating a solid brand identity, using visuals to your advantage, leveraging social media, creating a memorable business name, and focusing on customer experience, you can transform your business and achieve long\-term success.
