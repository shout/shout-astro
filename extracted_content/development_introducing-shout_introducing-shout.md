Introducing Shout: A Privacy\-First Survey Platform
===================================================

* March 23, 2023
* [Development](https://shout.com/category/development/)

<img src='https://shout.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/KwikSurveys-Rebrand-As-Shout.png' alt='KwikSurveys Has Rebranded As Shout' title='' width='860' height='381' />

Since KwikSurveys launched back in 2001 (22 years ago!), we’ve helped people power research and grow their businesses with feedback.

But as all of you’ve grown, so have we.

We realised that the name KwikSurveys no longer encompasses what we stand for, nor what we hope to achieve.

So, we’d like to introduce Shout.

This is more than just a name to us, it represents our desire to be heard (and to have you be heard). We know change can be disconcerting, so we want to assure you that we aren’t leaving you behind.

No, we’re taking you with us.

What does this mean for you?
----------------------------

In the coming weeks, you’ll notice several changes. Most notably, all traffic will be redirected from KwikSurveys.com to Shout.com, our brand new website.

We’ll have a completely new look and name, but there’s no cause for concern, we’ll still be run by the same devoted and hard working team.

**You won’t lose anything in your KwikSurveys account**. You’ll be able to log in via the Shout website, and find all your projects and data stored safely. The app will be completely re\-branded as Shout, along with all survey links

All our products will remain available to everyone who’s helped us get this far, that’s over 3 million people globally. But, we’ve got big plans for where we’re heading.

We’re going to do what our competitors have failed to do in a time where data protection regulations are popping up around the world. This will mean more features to help you collect data whilst ensuring your’re compliant.

You may have already noticed us roll out some of these features already, most notably including:

* GDPR compliant CRM groups
* Separate PII from response data
* We’ve gone cookieless

Recently, we’ve also made some major improvements to our builder and added a whole new survey format, where you can ask one question at a time. You can learn more about this and our other new features in our[latest release notes](https://shout.com/development/release-notes-one-question-at-a-time-surveys/).

We’d also like to share a few words from our CEO.

> To our valued customers,  
> 
> **I want to start by thanking you**. We couldn’t have gotten this far without you, and it’s important that you know that you’re the reason we continue to drive forward.  
> 
> Over the coming weeks, KwikSurveys will be transitioning to a new name, logo, and visual identity that better represents who we are and what we stand for.  
> 
> And so it’s my pleasure to introduce Shout.  
> 
> Let me share our reasons for this re\-brand with you.  
> 
> Firstly, we feel that the name KwikSurveys no longer accurately reflects the breadth and depth of our products. As you know, we’ve offered more than just surveys for a long time. You’re able to assess with quizzes, grow your audience with forms, manage contacts in our CRM, and much more.  
> 
> And since we have big plans for what else you’ll be able to do, now seems like the appropriate time for us to evolve our identity.  
> 
> Which brings us nicely to our second reason. As our product range grows, so will our values and mission. We’re striving to provide compliant tools for data collection and engaging audiences, and so our brand needs to be more modern, innovative, and reflective of our commitment to delivering those to you.  
> 
> Finally, we feel that this re\-brand is necessary for us to remain competitive in our ever\-growing industry. We want a brand that’s unique, memorable, and instantly recognisable to our customers, partners, and stakeholders.  
> 
> While our name may be changing, our commitment to providing exceptional products, services and support remains unchanged. We’re confident in this new future we’re forging and excited to continue working with you as Shout.  
> 
> Thank you for your continued support and loyalty, we couldn’t do this without you.
> 
> *David Meagor, CEO – Shout*
