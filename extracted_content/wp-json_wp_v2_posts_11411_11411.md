    Asking the right survey question types is essential to collecting valuable insights from your customers. Regardless of how you share your survey, the questions themselves are the most important aspect.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    Survey question falls into two categories: closed\-ended questions and open\-ended questions.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    [Closed\-ended questions\<\\/a\> ask respondents to choose from a pre\-set list of answers and will provide you with quantitative data, e.g., multiple\-choice questions.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    [Open\-ended questions\<\\/a\> allow respondents to write free\-form answers, e.g., text and comment boxes.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    What are the different survey question types?\<\\/h2\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                ------------------------------------------------------------------

    Here\\u2019s a list of the most common survey question types along with some examples to help you create your own survey.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

                        ### 1\. Multiple\-choice questions\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        Multiple\-choice questions provide a selection of answer choices for respondents to choose from. These questions are efficient because they allow respondents to scan the answers and choose the most appropriate one.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        There are two types of multiple\-choice questions: single\-select and multi\-select.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        #### Single\-select questions\<\\/h4\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        [Single\-select questions\<\\/a\> only allow a single answer choice and work well where the answer you provide different opinions or ideas. For example, binary questions must be single\-select because the answer choices represent two separate opinions.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        <img src='\"https:\/\/wp-stagesh.bugfree.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Multiple-Choice-Single-Select-Question-Type.png\"' alt='\"Multiple' title='' width='\"665\"' height='\"125\"' />\<\\/figure\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        #### Multi\-select questions\<\\/h4\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        Whereas [multi\-select questions\<\\/a\> enable respondents to select one or more answer choices (which can be defined by you). These work when you want respondents to express a range of opinions or preferences about the same topic, e.g. \\u201cplease select all that apply\\u201d.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        <img src='\"https:\/\/wp-stagesh.bugfree.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Multiple-Choice-Multi-Select-Question-Type.png\"' alt='\"Multi-Select' title='' width='\"665\"' height='\"225\"' />\<\\/figure\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        The downside of multiple\-choice questions is that they restrict respondents to a set of answers defined by you. If they have an opinion or experience that is not present in that list, they may not know how to answer.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        It can be difficult to make sure your answer options are collectively exhaustive, especially when you should have more than 7 or 8 answer choices per question. If you\\u2019re struggling with this, we\\u2019d recommend adding an ‘other’ answer option to allow respondents to write a custom answer.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        ### 2\. Rating scales\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        [Rating scale questions\<\\/a\> are numbered scales (usually from 1 to 10\) that ask respondents to choose a number on that scale.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        These question types should have text at either end in order to give respondents context of what each number represents. These are really useful when collecting feedback on customer service or product delivery, as they give you a quantifiable overview of how well you’re doing.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        For example, for a Net Promoter Score question, 0 would be labeled with Not Likely at all, and 10 would be labeled with Extremely likely.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        <img src='\"https:\/\/wp-stagesh.bugfree.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Rating-Scale-Question-Type.png\"' alt='\"Rating' title='' width='\"665\"' height='\"200\"' />\<\\/figure\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        ### 3\. Slider questions\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        [Sliders\<\\/a\> are similar to rating scales in that they require respondents to answer using a scale. The only difference is that they use a slider to choose that number as opposed to clicking a box.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        The bonus to these question types is that they\\u2019re a little more interactive, and give you the opportunity to switch things up in your survey without impacting the data you\\u2019re collecting.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        <img src='\"https:\/\/wp-stagesh.bugfree.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Slider-Question-Type.png\"' alt='\"Slider' title='' width='\"665\"' height='\"200\"' />\<\\/figure\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        ### 4\. Likert scales\\u200b\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        Likert Scale questions ask respondents the degree to which they agree or disagree with a question or statement.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        They\\u2019re great for finding out how people feel about a particular topic.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        For example, if you\\u2019re conducting a customer satisfaction survey you may want to find out how customers felt about the value for money of your product:\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        \\u201cDo you think our product is good value for money?\\u201d\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        Then your answer options can range from \\u201cNot at all good value for money\\u201d to \\u201cExtremely good value for money\\u201d.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        <img src='\"https:\/\/wp-stagesh.bugfree.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Likert-Scale-Question-Type.png\"' alt='\"Likert' title='' width='\"665\"' height='\"200\"' />\<\\/figure\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        ### 5\. Matrix questions\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        [Matrix questions\<\\/a\> allow you to ask multiple questions that all share the same Likert Scale. They\\u2019re great as they allow you to more questions without your respondents having to change the way they think about answering each question.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        However, the disadvantage to these questions is that they can be quite bulky on the page. We\\u2019d recommend sticking to 3 or 4 questions or statements per matrix.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        <img src='\"https:\/\/wp-stagesh.bugfree.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Matrix-Question-Type.png\"' alt='\"Matrix' title='' width='\"665\"' height='\"480\"' />\<\\/figure\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        ### 6\. Order ranking questions\\u200b\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        [Order ranking questions\<\\/a\> do what it says on the tin, they allow respondents to order answer choices by their own preference.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        The results from these question types will give you the average position of each answer option, so you can identify the most popular answer.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        It\\u2019s worth noting that you should only use these question types when your respondents are familiar with all the options. Otherwise, they might struggle with giving them a suitable order.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        <img src='\"https:\/\/wp-stagesh.bugfree.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Order-Ranking-Question-Type.png\"' alt='\"Order' title='' width='\"665\"' height='\"300\"' />\<\\/figure\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        ### 7\. Dropdown questions\\u200b\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        [Dropdown questions\<\\/a\> are similar to multiple\-choice, but naturally encourage longer lists of answer options. They are more suitable for this as the answers themselves are hidden on the page until the respondent opens the dropdown. Then, they simply need to scroll through the different answers until they find the most applicable.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        They work especially well for response options that would be easier to read when listed vertically rather than across the page. For example, Age Ranges, Countries, States, Job Roles, Etc.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        The best practice for dropdowns is always to write answers in a logical order. For the most part, this would mean listing answers alphabetically. This makes it easier for respondents to find what they\\u2019re looking for.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        <img src='\"https:\/\/wp-stagesh.bugfree.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Dropdown-Question-Type.png\"' alt='\"Drop' title='' width='\"665\"' height='\"150\"' />\<\\/figure\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        ### 8\. Net Promoter Score\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        [Net Promoter Score (NPS)\<\\/a\> is the industry standard for measuring customer loyalty. You can do this by asking one simple question:\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        \\u201cHow likely are you to recommend \[Company\\/ Product\\/ Service] to a friend or colleague?\\u201d\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        Customers then choose a number on a scale of 0 (Not very likely) to 10 (Extremely Likely).\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        This is essentially a scaled question, but most survey platforms will include this as a separate question type. This is because the chart for NPS would look very different from that of an average scaled question.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        Your NPS is calculated by dividing the percentage of promoters (selected 9 to 10\) by the percentage of detractors (selected 0 to 6\).\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        If you want an example of how this would be done, check out this handy NPS calculator.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        <img src='\"https:\/\/wp-stagesh.bugfree.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/NPS-Question-Type.png\"' alt='\"Net' title='' width='\"665\"' height='\"200\"' />\<\\/figure\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        ### 9\. Text questions\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        As we mentioned in the introduction, text\-based questions are open\-ended in nature as they allow respondents to write their own answers.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        [Text questions\<\\/a\> are a valuable source of feedback, and we encourage you to use them in your surveys. They can give you a great perspective of why respondents chose answers to close\-ended questions and allow them to go into more detail on their experiences.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        However, because open\-ended questions encourage custom feedback the answer tends to be longer and more time\-intensive to analyze.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        But we think the \\u2018bucketing\\u2019 method is a great way to analyze qualitative data.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        <img src='\"https:\/\/wp-stagesh.bugfree.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Text-Question-Type.png\"' alt='\"Text' title='' width='\"665\"' height='\"150\"' />\<\\/figure\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        ### 10\. Picture choice questions\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        Picture choice questions function in much the same way as multiple\-choice questions but allow respondents to select an image.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        Not only do these questions add an exciting visual element to your survey, but they are also excellent for concept testing. Whether you\\u2019re designing a new product, logo, or ad, you can get accurate and detailed feedback.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        We offer three different variants of this survey question type: single\-select, multi\-select, and comments.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        <img src='\"https:\/\/wp-stagesh.bugfree.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Picture-Choice-Question-Type.png\"' alt='\"Picture' title='' width='\"665\"' height='\"225\"' />\<\\/figure\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        #### Picture choice (single\-select)\<\\/h4\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        Respondents can select a [single image\<\\/a\> from among those provided.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        #### Picture choice (multi\-select)\<\\/h4\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        [Multiple images\<\\/a\> can be selected by respondents, the number is defined by the survey creator.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        #### Picture comments\<\\/h4\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        Instead of selecting an image, [picture comments questions\<\\/a\> include a text field for respondents to leave feedback beneath the images.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        ### 11\. Demographic questions\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        Demographic surveys questions are those that allow you to identify different things about your respondents. These can include:\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        \\n
                        - Age\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                        - Gender\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                        - Income\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                        - Location\<\\/li\>\\n\<\\/ul\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        These questions are essential to learning more about your audience and [building customer profiles\<\\/a\>.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        <img src='\"https:\/\/wp-stagesh.bugfree.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Demographic-Question-Type.png\"' alt='\"Demographic' title='' width='\"665\"' height='\"225\"' />\<\\/figure\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        ### 12\. Date questions\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        [Date question types\<\\/a\> allow you to collect dates and](\"https:\/\/wp-stagesh.bugfree.co.uk\/help\/article\/201-date\") [date ranges\<\\/a\> from your respondents.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        These are excellent for [event surveys\<\\/a\>, where you’d need to link responses to a certain day or register attendees for an event.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        <img src='\"https:\/\/wp-stagesh.bugfree.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Date-Question-Type.png\"' alt='\"Date' title='' width='\"665\"' height='\"450\"' />\<\\/figure\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        ### 13\. Star ratings\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        [Star rating questions\<\\/a\> ask customers to rate something along a scale of stars.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        You’d most likely have seen these on review sites, but they can be used for a variety of purposes. Whether you’re collecting feedback on your customer support process or the design of your website.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        <img src='\"https:\/\/wp-stagesh.bugfree.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Star-Rating-Question-Type.png\"' alt='\"Star' title='' width='\"665\"' height='\"160\"' />\<\\/figure\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        Tips for writing survey questions\<\\/h2\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                                                                        ------------------------------------------------------
                        Now that you’ve got your bearings with all the different question types, you\\u2019ll need to crack on with creating your survey. To help you get started, here are our top tips for [writing good survey questions\<\\/a\>:\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        \\n

                        Ask yourself what you\\u2019re trying to achieve with this survey, and what problem are you trying to solve. Then think about what feedback or data you\\u2019ll need in order to achieve this.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        Switching up the question types you use can also improve engagement from respondents and [increase your response rate\<\\/a\>. This just stops the format from becoming stale and will fend off survey fatigue.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
