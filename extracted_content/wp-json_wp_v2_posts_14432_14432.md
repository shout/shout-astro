We\\u2019re excited to announce the latest update to our survey platform, which introduces two new features guaranteed to enhance your survey and quiz creation experience.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

Along with these new features, we\\u2019ve added a few other exciting additions to make your surveys more engaging, interactive and personalized.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

One question at a time surveys\<\\/h2\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
---------------------------------------------------

Our latest survey type is designed to keep respondents engaged and increase completion rates.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

How? By displaying [one question at a time\<\\/a\>, which is perfect for short research and lead generation campaigns. This new survey type ensures that respondents stay focused and reduces the effects of](\"https:\/\/wp-stagesh.bugfree.co.uk\/help\/article\/326-one-question-surveys\") [survey fatigue\<\\/a\>.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

To create a one question at a time survey:\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

\\n

2. Click the \+ icon in your dashboard\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
3. Select ‘Survey’\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
4. Choose the ‘One’ survey type\<\\/li\>\\n\<\\/ol\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    Progress bar\<\\/h2\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
    ---------------------------------

    We\\u2019ve introduced a [progress bar\<\\/a\> that gives respondents a sneak peek of what\\u2019s in store for them. This feature will give them an idea of how long your survey will take to complete and what information they may need to prepare.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    Progress bars won\\u2019t list every question in your survey, they\\u2019ll only display your page or section titles.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    ### Hide sections from the progress bar\<\\/h3\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    We\\u2019ve made it possible to hide pages so that they don\\u2019t appear on your progress bar. This feature is especially useful if you\\u2019re using [Question Logic\<\\/a\>, where you can create custom paths through your survey based on respondents\\u2019 answer choices.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    This ensures that you provide the most personalized and engaging experience.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    To hide sections of questions from the progress bar:\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n

    \\n
        2. Click the \\u22ee icon next to the section title\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
        3. Select \\u2018Hide in progress bar\\u2019\<\\/li\>\\n\<\\/ol\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
            Page images\<\\/h2\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
            --------------------------------
            Take full control over your survey design with all\-new page images that can be added to an entire section or for a single question.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
            These images help provide context for any questions you have or ensure your branding is present throughout your survey. Get creative with your design and personalize your surveys to leave a lasting impression on respondents.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
            <img src='\"https:\/\/wp-stagesh.bugfree.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Add-Page-Images-To-Surveys-And-Quizzes.png\"' alt='\"Add' title='' width='\"808\"' height='\"413\"' />\<\\/figure\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
            Welcome section\<\\/h2\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                ------------------------------------
            We\\u2019ve added a welcome section to help you greet respondents and share any important information about your research or data processing activities. This section is perfect for setting the expectations for your respondents.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
            By default, this section will be present when you create a new single\-question\-per\-page survey.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
            To add another to your survey:\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
            \\n

            Theme filters\<\\/h2\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        ----------------------------------
            When you now head into the Themes menu in the builder, you\\u2019ll see a new filter menu you can interact with. This allows you to more easily find the best theme design for your survey.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
            These filters are only available for classic surveys, but not to worry. We\\u2019ve handpicked the best selection of existing themes for one\-question surveys and added a new range that have been specially optimized for this survey type.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
            Disable auto\-scroll\<\\/h2\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                        -----------------------------------------
            We\\u2019ve introduced the option to disable the question highlight bar and auto\-scroll feature for Many question survey types. This will give you more control over your survey and allow you to personalize the experience for your respondents.\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
            To disable auto\-scroll for classic surveys:\<\\/p\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
            \\n
                            2. Open the Theme menu\<\\/li\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                            3. Switch \\u2018Highlight next question (auto\-scroll) off\<\\/li\>\\n\<\\/ol\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
                                Wrapping up\<\\/h2\>\\n\\n\\n\\n
