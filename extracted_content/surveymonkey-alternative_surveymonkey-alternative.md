Compliance is built in with Shout
---------------------------------

Collect feedback and grow your contact lists without worrying about whether you’re compliant.

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

#### Compliance Groups

Group contacts by your lawful basis for processing their data, such as Legitimate Interests, Consent, and Contract.

Not supported by SurveyMonkey

### User\-friendly software

Shout is a SurveyMonkey alternative that’s easy to use with support staff that’s ready to help if you ever have a question.

### AI question prediction

Paste your questions into our prediction tool and Shout will recommend the best question type for you to use.

### Automatic reporting

Professional reports are generated automatically for surveys, quizzes, forms, and email invitation campaigns.

### Shout endlessly

Unlike SurveyMonkey, Shout doesn’t place any limits on the number of collectors that can be used per survey.

The same features, without restrictions
---------------------------------------

Choose survey software that gives you access to the same industry\-standard features without unnecessary limitations and rules.

### Shout

**\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

#### Unlimited responses**

With Shout you can collect unlimited responses per survey with all of our annual plans. We don’t cap your responses per survey, per month, or year!

**\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

#### Team users as standard**

Shout bundles additional users (seats) into plans without inflating their price. Enabling you to collaborate on surveys and reports without blowing your budget.

**\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

#### Branding and customisation**

You can fully customise designs, add logos, and align surveys with your brand guidelines with any of our plans. Host surveys on your own domain without having to subscribe to an Enterprise plan.

### SurveyMonkey

**\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

#### Limited responses**

The number of survey responses you can collect per month/ year depends on the plan you’re subscribed to. The cheapest available annual plan restricts you to 2500 responses a year.

**\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

#### Cost per user**

SurveyMonkey offers team users and collaboration but charges £25 per user per month (and that’s with their cheapest team plan). On top of that, you have to start with at least 3 users.

**\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

#### Design comes with a higher price**

Customising your survey design and adding logos will require you to subscribe to SurveyMonkey’s Advantage Annual plan, which costs £384 every year.
