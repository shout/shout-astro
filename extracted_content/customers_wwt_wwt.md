What problem Shout solved for WWT
---------------------------------

\[SVG\_REMOVED]\[SVG\_REMOVED]

Initially we used SurveyMonkey to collect feedback, but we couldn’t reconcile their high\-cost against the features they offered. Shout’s affordability was a breath of fresh air, and the **cost savings didn’t come at the expense of functionality**; in fact, Shout not only matched but surpassed the capabilities of SurveyMonkey.

At the heart of our mission is the commitment to education, accomplished through school visits and learning programs. Shout has been instrumental in achieving our educational goals by revolutionizing the way we gather and analyze feedback from the educators who participate in our programs.
