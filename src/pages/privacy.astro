              <p>
                We use the information collected to provide our services to you, including:
              </p>
              <ul>

                <li>To send you notifications about updates to community content you've subscribed to or participated in.</li>

                We do not use the information you provide to make any automated decisions that might affect you.
              </p>

              <h3>Communications from the Site</h3>
              <p>
                All new Creators are sent an email confirmation message when creating an account with the Site for the purpose of verifying their registration.
              </p>
              <p>
                New Creators of Shout.com will receive communications regarding their 14 Day Free Trial. These communications will be sent at intervals throughout the Free Trial, but will conclude upon the expiration of the Free Trial.
              </p>
              <p>
                Occasionally, we may deem it necessary to send service-related emails to relevant Creators. For example, if the Site experiences an unexpected outage or unscheduled maintenance, it may be necessary to contact Creators to inform them of this. Generally, it's not possible to opt-out of these emails, as they are not deemed promotional.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you contact us via our support email, we will send communications for as long as it is necessary to resolve an issue or answer a query submitted by you. You can, at any time, request that we no longer use this personal data to contact you. If you wish to do so, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:help@freeonlinesurveys.com">help@freeonlinesurveys.com</a> (for FreeOnlineSurveys Creators) or <a href="mailto:help@shout.com">help@shout.com</a> (for Shout Creators).
              </p>

              <h3>Community Features and Notifications</h3>
              <p>
                When you participate in our community features (such as feature voting, suggestions, or public forums), your username and profile information will be publicly displayed alongside your contributions as a required part of these services.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you subscribe to community content or vote on features, you will receive email notifications about updates and changes to that content. You can manage your notification preferences in your account settings at any time.
              </p>

              <h2 id="third-parties">Information shared from third-parties</h2>
              <p>
                When you choose to register or log in using a third-party service (such as Google Sign-In or Microsoft), we collect your name, email address, and profile picture as permitted by your settings with that service. We use your basic profile information to verify your identity, create your account, and manage your user profile. Additional permissions, such as Gmail, Meta, and Outlook integrations, are governed by the specific terms outlined below. This data is encrypted in transit and at rest.
              </p>
              <p>
                Shout's use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements.
              </p>

              <h3 id="email-integrations">Email Integrations (Gmail and Outlook)</h3>
              <p>
                If you choose to connect your Gmail or Microsoft Outlook account to Shout to use our shared inbox email features, we will request permission to send emails on your behalf. For Gmail, we use the <code>gmail.send</code> scope. We use these permissions strictly to allow you to compose and send messages and replies to respondents directly from the Shout platform using your connected email address.
              </p>
              <p>
                To provide this functionality, Shout will process the content of emails you compose within our platform, along with the recipient email addresses and sending timestamps. <strong>We do not use these permissions to read, access, scan, or delete your existing or incoming emails.</strong> The data processed through these integrations is used exclusively to facilitate your sending requests and to maintain your outgoing message history within your Shout shared inbox.
              </p>
              <p>
                We do not sell this data or share your email sending capabilities with any unauthorised third parties. You may disconnect your email account from Shout at any time via your account settings, which will immediately revoke our ability to send emails on your behalf.
              </p>

              <h3 id="messaging-integrations">Messaging Integrations (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp)</h3>
              <p>
                If you choose to connect your Facebook Page, Instagram Business account, or WhatsApp Business account to Shout, we will process messages sent and received through those channels within your shared inbox. This allows you to manage conversations with your customers and respondents from a single place.
              </p>
              <p>
                To provide this functionality, we collect and store the names and platform identifiers of people who message you, the content of messages (including text, images, videos, audio, documents, and other attachments), and delivery and read status information. For WhatsApp, we also process phone numbers and any location data shared within messages.
              </p>
              <p>
                We use this data exclusively to facilitate your conversations and to send replies on your behalf. <strong>We do not access your personal social media content, posts, or followers.</strong> We do not sell this data or share it with any unauthorised third parties. All access tokens for connected accounts are encrypted at rest. You may disconnect any connected account from Shout at any time via your inbox settings, which will immediately revoke our access to that channel.
              </p>

              <h2 id="disclosure">Disclosure of your personal data</h2>
              <p>
                We use sub-processors to deliver some of our services and to ensure your data is stored safely and securely. All sub-processors we use have the appropriate security and organisational measure in place to keep your data secure. You can find a full list of the sub-processors we use to provide this service at the following link: <a href="https://shout.com/help/article/173-our-sub-processors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Our sub processors</a>.
              </p>

              <h3>Payment information</h3>
              <p>
                We also use the following payment processors to manage card payments taken through the Site:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>BrainTree (<a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/gb/legal/braintree-privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BrainTree Privacy Policy</a>)</li>

              <h3>Disclosure upon request</h3>
              <p>
                When a billing contact differs from the Creator, we may disclose account or billing information to them upon request.
              </p>
              <p>
                We may disclose account details to your organisation, in cases where a Creator account belongs to the organisation itself.
              </p>

              <h3>Change of ownership</h3>
              <p>
                We may disclose account details if there is a change of ownership, merger or other corporate change. In this case, you agree that the successor will process the above personal data instead of Problem Free Limited following a notice given to all Problem Free Customers 1 month prior to this change.
              </p>

              <h3>Data transfers outside of the UK and EEA</h3>
              <p>
                Personal data for which we are the data controller may be stored or transferred outside of the UK and EEA and may be processed by third-parties for the purpose of providing Problem Free Limited with their services. This primarily includes transfers to the United States for infrastructure and service delivery.
              </p>
              <p>
                These services are essential to the continued operation of the Site and efficiently providing our services to you. All third-party processors are subject to a data processing agreement and, where required, are bound by the UK International Data Transfer Agreement (IDTA) or the UK Addendum to the EU Standard Contractual Clauses to ensure compliant standards for international data transfers.
              </p>
