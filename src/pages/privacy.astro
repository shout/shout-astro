              </p>
              <p>
                Problem Free Limited acts as a data controller for all personal data that our Creators and Visitors input, except for any personal data that is input by Respondents or that we process on behalf of Creators.
              </p>
              <p>
                For any personal data input by Respondents or that we process on behalf of Creators, Problem Free Limited acts as a data processor, and Creators act as the data controllers.
              </p>

              </p>

              <h2 id="data-we-collect">The personal data we collect about you</h2>

              <h3>Communications from the Site</h3>
              <p>
                All new Creators are sent an email confirmation message when creating an account with the Site for the purpose of verifying their registration.
              </p>
              <p>
                New Creators of Shout.com will receive communications regarding their 14 Day Free Trial. These communications will be sent at intervals throughout the Free Trial, but will conclude upon the expiration of the Free Trial.
              </p>
              <p>
                Occasionally, we may deem it necessary to send service-related emails to relevant Creators. For example, if the Site experiences an unexpected outage or unscheduled maintenance, it may be necessary to contact Creators to inform them of this. Generally, it's not possible to opt-out of these emails, as they are not deemed promotional.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you contact us via our support email, we will send communications for as long as it is necessary to resolve an issue or answer a query submitted by you. You can, at any time, request that we no longer use this personal data to contact you. If you wish to do so, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:help@freeonlinesurveys.com">help@freeonlinesurveys.com</a> (for FreeOnlineSurveys Creators) or <a href="mailto:help@shout.com">help@shout.com</a> (for Shout Creators).

              </p>
              <p>

              <h2 id="third-parties">Information shared from third-parties</h2>
              <p>
                When you choose to register or log in using a third-party service (such as Google Sign-In), we collect your name, email address, and profile picture as permitted by your settings with that service. We use this information solely to verify your identity, create your account, and manage your user profile. This data is encrypted in transit and at rest.
              </p>

              <h2 id="disclosure">Disclosure of your personal data</h2>
              <p>
                We use sub-processors to deliver some of our services and to ensure your data is stored safely and securely.

              </p>
              <p>
                We may disclose account details to your organisation, in cases where a Creator account belongs to the organisation itself.
              </p>

              <h3>Change of ownership</h3>
              <p>
                We may disclose account details if there is a change of ownership, merger or other corporate change. In this case, you agree that the successor will process the above personal data instead of Problem Free Limited following a notice given to all Problem Free Customers 1 month prior to this change.
              </p>

              <h3>Data transfers outside of the UK and EEA</h3>
              <p>
                Personal data for which we are the data controller may be stored or transferred outside of the UK and EEA and may be processed by third-parties for the purpose of providing Problem Free Limited with their services.
              </p>
              <p>
                These services are essential to the continued operation of the Site and efficiently providing our services to you. All third party processors are subject to a data processing agreement or are bound by standard contractual clauses that guarantee compliant standards for data transfers.
