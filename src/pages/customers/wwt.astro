          <h2 class="text-4xl lg:text-5xl font-bold lg:tracking-tight mb-6">What problem Shout solved</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Initially WWT used SurveyMonkey to collect feedback, but they couldn't reconcile the high cost against the features offered. Shout's affordability was a breath of fresh air, and the <strong>cost savings didn't come at the expense of functionality</strong>.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            In fact, Shout not only matched but surpassed the capabilities of SurveyMonkey.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
            At the heart of WWT's mission is the commitment to education, accomplished through school visits and learning programs. Shout has been instrumental in achieving their educational goals by revolutionizing the way they gather and analyze feedback from educators who participate in their programs.
