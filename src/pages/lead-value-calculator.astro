  {
    question: "How do you calculate lead value?",
    answer: "<p>There are two ways you can calculate the value of leads. Firstly is to take the revenue (gross profit) made from a lead generation campaign and divide it by the number of leads generated.</p><p><strong>Gross Lead Value = Revenue / Number of leads generated</strong></p><p>Of course, you may want to exclude what you spent on a campaign. In this case, you would take income (net profit) and divide it by the number of leads captured.</p><p><strong>Net Lead Value = ( Revenue – Campaign spend ) / Number of leads generated</strong></p>"
  },
  {
    question: "How do you calculate lead volume?",
    answer: "<p>Your optimal lead volume can be calculated by considering three factors; desired revenue, average customer spend, and lead conversion rate.</p><p><strong>Lead Volume = New revenue goal / (Average customer revenue × Lead conversion rate)</strong></p><p>Luckily, our <a href='/lead-generation-calculator/'>lead generation calculator</a> will help you estimate lead volume that's right for your business.</p>"
  },
  {
    question: "What is lead rate?",
    answer: "<p>Lead rate (aka. lead conversion rate) is the percentage of leads that are successfully converted into paying customers. This metric can be calculated by dividing the number of converted leads by the total number of leads, then multiplying that number by 100.</p><p><strong>Lead rate = (Converted leads / Total number of leads) × 100</strong></p>"
  },
  {
    question: "How do you calculate lead acquisition cost?",
    answer: "<p>Lead acquisition cost is calculated by taking the total cost of a lead generation campaign, and dividing that by the number of leads acquired.</p><p><strong>Lead acquisition cost = Total cost of lead generation campaign / Number of leads generated</strong></p>"
