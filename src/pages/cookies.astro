            <p class="text-green-900 mb-0">
              Shout.com is built with privacy at its core. Unlike most websites, we don't use tracking cookies, advertising cookies, or analytics cookies. We believe your data belongs to you, not to advertisers.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2>Our approach to cookies</h2>
          <p>
            Shout.com is a cookieless site and application. We've deliberately chosen not to use the tracking technologies that have become commonplace across the web. There are no third-party analytics scripts watching your every move, no advertising networks building profiles about you, and no social media trackers following you around the internet.
          </p>
          <p>
            This isn't just a policy - it's a fundamental part of how we've built our platform. We believe that privacy-respecting software shouldn't be the exception; it should be the standard.
          </p>

          <h2>When cookies may be used</h2>
          <p>
            While our public website and survey/form/quiz experiences are completely cookieless, there are two limited scenarios where cookies are used:
          </p>

          <h3>1. Authentication and session management</h3>
          <p>
            When you log in to your Shout account, we use essential session cookies to keep you securely signed in. These cookies are strictly necessary for the application to function and contain no tracking information. They are automatically deleted when you log out or close your browser.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Optional duplicate response prevention</h3>
          <p>
            Creators may optionally enable a feature to prevent duplicate responses from the same device. When enabled, this places a small cookie on the Respondent's device after their response is saved. This cookie simply indicates that a response has been submitted - <strong>no personally identifiable information is collected or stored through this feature</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This feature is entirely optional and disabled by default. Creators choose whether to enable it based on their specific needs.
          </p>

          <h2>What we don't do</h2>

          </ul>
