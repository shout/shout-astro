              <p>
                This Privacy Policy applies to Shout and FreeOnlineSurveys (henceforth: "the Site") which are owned and operated by Problem Free Limited (registration number: 04602671) of Engineers House, 25 South Road, Portishead, BS20 7DU United Kingdom.
              </p>

              <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
              <p>
                This privacy policy describes the information we collect about Respondents when they interact with projects created by Creators on the Site.
              </p>
              <p>
                Problem Free Limited acts as a <strong>data processor</strong> for personal data collected about Respondents by Creators. The Creators act as the <strong>data controller</strong> and are responsible for ensuring they have a lawful basis to collect your data.
              </p>

              <h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>
              <p>
                <strong>"Respondents"</strong> are those who fill out surveys, quizzes, or forms created through the Site, communicate with Creators via the shared inbox (including email), or have their data processed by Problem Free Limited by the Creator inputting their personal data into their account.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>"Creators"</strong> are account holders who use tools on the Site to create projects (surveys, quizzes, forms), collect data, manage contacts, or manage conversations via the shared inbox.
              </p>

              <h2 id="data-we-collect">The personal data we collect about you</h2>
              <p>
                In order to provide the service to Creators, we collect the following information about Respondents:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Survey meta information:</strong> your IP address is collected when you respond to a survey, but it is anonymised before being stored by deleting the second half of the address before it is recorded to our database.</li>
                <li><strong>Log data:</strong> our web servers keep log files that record data each time a device accesses those servers. The log files contain data about the nature of each access, including originating IP addresses, browser agent, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system versions, device type and timestamps.</li>
                <li><strong>Device and browser data:</strong> information about the device and browser used to access the Site.</li>
                <li><strong>Referrer data:</strong> if you have arrived from an external site (e.g. a link from an email or webpage), the source URL may be recorded.</li>
                <li><strong>Essential cookies:</strong> we use essential cookies only (no analytics or third-party trackers) on survey and form collection pages. These are used to prevent duplicate responses.</li>
                <li><strong>Application log data:</strong> personal data (e.g. error details, application performance logging) may be stored in error logs, which are used to resolve bugs and ensure the Site is operating efficiently. We attempt to mask IP addresses before they are stored, however error logs may contain some personal data.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Data we process on behalf of Creators</h3>
              <p>
                The following data is collected and controlled by Creators. We process it on their behalf as a <strong>data processor</strong> only. The Creator's own privacy policy governs how this data is used, and you should contact the Creator directly to exercise your rights regarding this data.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Survey, form, and quiz responses:</strong> your answers and any personal data included in your responses.</li>
                <li><strong>Inbox and conversation data:</strong> if you communicate with a Creator via the shared inbox (including email), your message content, email address, attachments, and timestamps.</li>
                <li><strong>CRM data:</strong> any personal data the Creator stores about you in their contact records.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 id="how-we-use-data">How we use the personal data we collect</h2>
              <p>
                We do not use the operational data collected about you for purposes other than:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Providing support, for example when contacted by Respondents regarding a response they have submitted.</li>
                <li>Abuse monitoring.</li>
                <li>Network defence, DDOS protection, and application security.</li>
                <li>Debugging and application optimisation.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Data we process on behalf of Creators (survey responses, inbox conversations, CRM data) is used solely to provide the service to the Creator. This includes receiving, routing, and storing messages so Creators can manage conversations, and sending replies on their behalf. We do not use this data for any other purpose.
              </p>
              <p>
                We do not use the information you provide to make any automated decisions that might affect you.
              </p>
              <p>
                We do not sell your data, nor would we contact you for any purpose other than providing support to you or on the request of a Creator.
              </p>
              <p>
                We only share data with third parties that are necessary to provide our service to Creators and maintain the operation of the Site.
              </p>

              <h2 id="disclosure">Disclosure of your personal data</h2>
              <p>
                We use sub-processors to deliver some of our services and to ensure your data is stored safely and securely.

              <h2 id="your-rights">Your rights</h2>
              <p>
                As Problem Free Limited acts as a <strong>data processor</strong> for Respondent data, the Creator is the data controller and is responsible for handling your rights requests.

                If you wish to <strong>access, rectify, erase, restrict the processing of, or object to the processing of</strong> your data, you must contact the Creator directly, as they act as the data controller.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you believe that a Creator is not acting in compliance with our <a href="/terms/">Terms and Conditions</a> or applicable data protection law, you may contact us at <a href="mailto:help@shout.com">help@shout.com</a>.
              </p>

              </p>

              <h2 id="retention">Retention policy</h2>
              <p>
                Creators determine the retention periods for any personal data they hold about you, including survey responses, form submissions, and inbox conversations. If you have any questions about this, you should contact the Creator directly.
              </p>

              <h2 id="complaints">Your right to complain</h2>
              <p>
                If you have a complaint about how your data has been handled, you should contact the Creator in the first instance, as they are the data controller. If you believe we, as the data processor, have not acted appropriately, you may contact us at <a href="mailto:help@shout.com">help@shout.com</a>.
