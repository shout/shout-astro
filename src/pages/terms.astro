              <h3>Connected Accounts and Integrations</h3>
              <p>
                Our Services allow you to connect third-party accounts, such as Gmail, Microsoft Outlook, Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, to send and receive messages through your shared inbox. By connecting a third-party account, you authorise Problem Free to send messages and perform actions on your behalf through that account.
              </p>
              <p>
                You are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of connected accounts complies with the terms and policies of the relevant third-party platform, including the developer and messaging policies of Google, Microsoft, and Meta.

              </p>
              <p>
                These integrations rely on services operated by third parties. Problem Free does not control and is not responsible for the availability, uptime, or functionality of third-party platforms. Changes to a third party's APIs, terms, or services may affect or limit the availability of an integration, and Problem Free shall not be liable for any such disruption.

              <p>
                We reserve the right to limit, suspend, or revoke your access to any third-party integration at any time if we reasonably believe your use violates these Terms of Service or the policies of the relevant third-party platform. This may occur without prior notice where necessary to protect the integrity of our Services or our standing with third-party providers.

              <h2 id="payments">6 - Payments and Payment Security</h2>

              <h3>Subscription Fees</h3>
              <p>
                Subscription fees are generally charged in advance of the services being provided, on a rolling monthly or annual basis. Fees paid are non-refundable except as provided in these Terms of Service or when required by law.
              </p>

              <h3>Automatic Renewal</h3>
              <p>
                The term of each subscription is automatically renewed at the end of the subscription period (monthly or annually) unless cancelled by you. For annual subscriptions, we will send a payment reminder a few days before the renewal date. It is your responsibility to ensure your payment details are up to date.
              </p>

              <h3>Cancellation and Refunds</h3>
              <p>
                You may cancel the automatic renewal of your subscription at any time through your account settings or by contacting our support team. There is a 14-day cooling-off period, starting the day after a subscription is made, during which you can cancel your subscription and receive a full refund. After the 14-day cooling-off period, no refund will be given for cancellation, but you may continue to use the Services under your subscription package until the end of your current subscription term.
              </p>

              <h3>Changes in Fees</h3>
              <p>
                Fees are subject to change. Any changes will become effective upon the renewal of your subscription term. We will endeavor to notify you by email of any changes in your subscription price before they take effect.
              </p>

              <h3>Mid-term Upgrades</h3>
              <p>
                If you upgrade your subscription midway through a current subscription term, we will apply a pro-rated refund on your account for the remaining term of your lower subscription and apply the new subscription rate to the remainder of your current term. Once your subscription renews, the full upgrade price shall apply.
              </p>

              <h3>Payment Methods</h3>
              <p>
                We accept payment via credit card, direct debit, or other methods as specified on our website. You are responsible for providing accurate and current payment information.
              </p>

              <h3>Failed Payments</h3>
              <p>
                If a payment fails, we may attempt to process the charge again within a few days. If the payment continues to fail, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Services.
              </p>

              <h3>Taxes</h3>
              <p>
                Fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities.
              </p>

              <h3>Exceeding Plan Limits</h3>
              <p>
                If you exceed the limits of your current subscription plan, we may automatically upgrade your plan or apply additional charges to the account at the next renewal.
              </p>

              <h3>Account Termination</h3>
              <p>
                In the event of account termination, whether initiated by you or us, you will not be entitled to a refund for any prepaid fees.
              </p>
              <p>
                By using our Services, you agree to these payment terms. Failure to comply with these terms may result in the suspension or termination of your account and Services.

              <h2 id="special-category">Special Category Data</h2>
              <p>
                Our Services include a feature that enables the separation of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from the remaining respondent answers, effectively anonymizing the data. When properly anonymized, such data loses its status as special category data under applicable data protection laws.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you intend to collect or process any special category data as defined by applicable data protection laws (including but not limited to data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, data concerning health, or data concerning a person's sex life or sexual orientation), you are required to use this anonymization feature.
              </p>
              <p>
                By using our Services, you agree that:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>You will use the anonymization feature for all special category data collected through our Services, thereby converting it to non-special category data.</li>
                <li>You take full responsibility for ensuring that the anonymization feature is properly implemented for all special category data, rendering it truly anonymized and no longer subject to special category data protections.</li>
                <li>You acknowledge that once properly anonymized using our feature, the data will no longer be considered special category data, and you will treat it accordingly.</li>
                <li>You understand that failure to use the anonymization feature for special category data may result in immediate termination of your account and potential legal consequences.</li>
                <li>You will indemnify and hold Problem Free Limited harmless from any claims, damages, or liabilities arising from your failure to properly anonymize special category data or from any misuse of anonymized data.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Problem Free Limited reserves the right to audit your use of the Services to ensure compliance with this requirement. Failure to comply may result in immediate termination of your account and Services.
              </p>
              <p>
                By using the anonymization feature as required, you acknowledge that you are responsible for ensuring the data truly loses its special category status, and that Problem Free Limited is not processing special category data in providing its Services to you.

                Sub-users will continue to be liable for their own billing unless the organisation owner chooses to take over the billing for that account through the "consolidate billing" option in the "My account/organisation" menu.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you join an existing organisation by accepting an invitation then you agree to transfer ownership of your account and all data it contains to that organisation. You will continue to be responsible for any new or existing billing for a paid plan until the company chooses to consolidate billing to their organisation. Billing consolidation is optional and does not happen automatically when joining.
              </p>
              <p>
                Team members must be employed by the same legal organisation if paying as a single pooled account.
