How do you ask ask guests for feedback in the hotel industry?
-------------------------------------------------------------

There are a multitude of ways you can ask for feedback from hotel guests, including:

One common approach is to send [email surveys](https://shout.com/email-marketing/email-surveys-guide/) to guests shortly after their stay. Using an online [survey maker](https://shout.com/survey-maker/) gives you a great deal of control over the design and branding of your guest survey.

The other benefit is that all the data is compiled for you in digital reports, where (depending on the provider you choose) tools for analysing data.

With Shout, you can upload your contacts to our [integrated CRM](https://shout.com/crm/), create email invitations, and even send reminders to those yet to respond.

### QR codes

Placing QR codes in prominent locations, such as reception desks, guest rooms, or restaurant menus, is a convenient way to encourage guests to provide feedback.

When scanned with a smartphone, the [QR code](https://shout.com/help/article/87-qr-code) can direct guests to an online survey where they can share their thoughts. This method leverages technology and makes it easy for guests to participate.

### Paper surveys

Traditional paper surveys are still used in some hotels. These surveys can be placed in guest rooms, handed out at the front desk, or left in common areas.

While less common in the digital age, some guests may prefer the tactile experience of filling out a physical survey.

### Tablet or kiosk surveys

Some hotels have introduced tablets or kiosks in common areas where guests can complete surveys on the spot.

These interactive surveys can capture immediate feedback while it’s still fresh in the guest’s mind.

### In\-person interviews

For more in\-depth feedback, especially for special occasions or events, hotels may conduct in\-person interviews with guests during their stay. This approach can provide rich [qualitative data](https://freeonlinesurveys.com/survey-research/qualitative-data-collection) but may be more resource\-intensive.

To maximize the effectiveness of these methods, it’s important to keep surveys concise, user\-friendly, and mobile\-responsive.

Additionally, it’s crucial to assure guests that their feedback will be used to improve the quality of their future stays.
