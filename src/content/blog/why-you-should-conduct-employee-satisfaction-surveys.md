Employee satisfaction surveys are crucial to the success of a company. It's said that [happy and satisfied employees work better with their teams](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/edri/2021/1751495/), are more productive, and are more likely to stay with their companies for a longer period of time.

To understand how your employees are doing and if they have any concerns, conducting an employee satisfaction survey can be helpful.

Companies typically conduct customer satisfaction surveys but often neglect doing the same for their employees. As we previously mentioned in our blog, [customers are the lifeline of your business](https://shout.com/survey-design/how-to-create-a-customer-satisfaction-survey/) and their experiences with you can contribute to your future success.

Similarly, your employees are also as important to your company, and knowing what they think is important to your continued success.

## 4 Reasons to conduct employee satisfaction surveys

If you need more information on why you should conduct an [employee satisfaction survey](https://shout.com/employee-satisfaction-surveys/), continue reading below.

### 1. Build an understanding of your employees

Employee satisfaction surveys are one way for you to understand what your employees are feeling. This survey can track their sentiments over time so that you can make sure you're addressing their needs.

Moreover, this can help you understand if your employees need extra help, new resources, or if any changes in the company are not as favorable for them.

### 2. Improve your employees' well-being

You should also consider your employees' well-being. If employees are struggling with something personal or work-related, it should be your priority to assist in any way you can. [Leaders can promote a culture of well-being](https://www.lhh.com/uk/en/insights/five-steps-leaders-can-take-to-promote-a-culture-of-wellbeing-at-work) if they can consider their employees' physical and mental health.

For example, more employees are now favoring the hybrid work setup but most companies are insisting they come back to a normal work setup.

However, this can have a negative impact on how they've become accustomed to working. An employee satisfaction survey can easily highlight this and inform your strategy going forward.

### 3. Give your employees a voice

Some employees are used to being seen and not heard. This propagates a culture of employees keeping quiet on topics you need their input.

An employee satisfaction survey will provide a way for them to share their thoughts. This will let them know that you are listening to them and value their opinion.

For this, you might also consider an [confidential survey](https://shout.com/survey-design/anonymous-vs-confidential-surveys/) so that your employees can feel comfortable answering your questions.

### 4. Boost employee engagement

Conducting regular employee satisfaction surveys allows you to get your employees' insights and opinions on company matters. With this, you can make improvements and changes to the workplace for your employees' benefit.

This will help them feel valued, as they see that you're considering their perspective when making company decisions. Which will go a long way in boosting employee morale and engagement.

This in turn engages employees that are more productive and are happier with their jobs. It will also help them feel more satisfied with your company, therefore, [lowering employee turnover rates](https://www.benefitnews.com/opinion/3-ways-employers-can-utilize-employee-engagement-tech-to-reduce-turnover).

## How to measure employee satisfaction

The easiest way to collect feedback on employee satisfaction (eSAT) is to use an online survey tool. This way, you'll have access to a range of interactive [question types](https://shout.com/survey-design/survey-question-types/) to keep employees engaged and collect the data you need.

We'd recommend that your survey responses are collected anonymously, this will encourage employees to provide honest feedback.

When it comes to employee satisfaction survey questions, you'll need to consider the different aspects of their job, work environment, and company culture.

For example, one of the most common factors to ask about is whether employees feel that have a good work-life balance. Questions such as this can gift huge amounts of insight to managers and human resources. Enabling them to action positive changes in the workplace.

### Employee satisfaction questions

Here are some other examples of employee satisfaction survey questions:

* Are your goals clearly defined by your manager?
* Are you happy with the level of internal communication?
* What changes would impact your role in a positive way?
* Do you have access to all the resources you need to perform your role?

You'll likely be asking a lot of [closed-ended questions](https://shout.com/survey-design/close-ended-questions/) that require employees to agree or disagree with statements, for which you can use matrix (Likert scale) or multiple-choice question types.

But it's essential that you collect open feedback as well. This will give you insight into why employees feel a certain way and will help you inform change.

### Employee Net Promoter Score

Another method for measuring job satisfaction is to ask an Employee Net Promoter Score question (eNPS). This is similar to the standard [NPS question](https://shout.com/survey-design/net-promoter-score-how-to-calculate-nps/), in that it asks a single question to gauge loyalty based on experiences. Although, you'd reframe the language to target employees instead of customers.

Here's the eNPS question:

"*On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend [Company] as a place to work?*"

Asking this gives you a birds-eye view of how your employees feel about working at your company. But again, don't just stop there, you should follow up with two or three [open-ended questions](https://shout.com/survey-design/open-ended-questions/) to find out why they gave that rating and what improvements they can suggest.
