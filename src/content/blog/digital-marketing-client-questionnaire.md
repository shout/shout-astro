What is a digital marketing client questionnaire?
-------------------------------------------------

A digital marketing client questionnaire is simply a series of questions designed to better understand a client’s business, goals, and preferences in relation to digital marketing.

They typically cover various aspects such as the client’s business background, target audience, current marketing efforts, goals, and expectations.

Their purpose is to facilitate effective communication, align marketing strategies with client objectives, and establish a foundation for a successful digital marketing campaign.

Why conduct a client questionnaire?
-----------------------------------

Let’s get into some of the reasons you should conduct client questionnaires.

### Establish a strong client\-agency relationship

The questionnaire serves as the starting point for creating a connection, providing a platform for [clear communication](https://shout.com/customer-experience/customer-communication-strategies/), and ensuring that the marketing strategy aligns seamlessly with the client’s vision.

### Tailor strategies to client goals

Understanding your client’s business goals is pivotal to developing a tailored marketing strategy.

By gaining insights into their long\-term objectives, marketing agencies can align their efforts to contribute meaningfully to the client’s growth.

### Understand client expectations

They also allow clients to set expectations, and act as a permanent record of these for easy reference.

So, rather than contacting your client with a litany of questions, the account manager can reference these at any point throughout the campaign.

Crafting effective questions for clients
----------------------------------------

We wanted to include some advice to help you [write questions](https://shout.com/survey-design/writing-good-survey-questions/) for client questionnaires.

### Use a mix of open\-ended and closed\-ended questions

It’s important that you strike a good balance between open\-ended and closed\-ended questions.

*Closed\-Ended Question (Multiple\-Choice)*

[Closed\-ended questions](https://shout.com/survey-design/close-ended-questions/) provide a set list of answer options for clients to choose from, whilst [open\-ended questions](https://shout.com/survey-design/open-ended-questions/) allow for text\-based responses.

*Open\-Ended Question (Comment Box)*

Closed questions are easier to quantify, but open questions often provide much needed context for those selections.

### Avoid industry jargon

Tailor questions to be easily understandable, avoiding unnecessary jargon or technical terms. This ensures that both the client and the marketing team can engage in a clear and meaningful dialogue.

### Specify digital marketing channels

Write questions that refer to specific digital marketing channels such as social media, [SEO](https://shout.com/seo/seo-secrets/), PPC, etc. This ensures that the gathered information is directly applicable to the chosen marketing strategy.

How to share a digital marketing client questionnaire
-----------------------------------------------------

Whilst you’ll likely be in contact with the client before sharing the questionnaire, you have a wide range of options for sharing the questionnaire and collecting responses.

This will vary depending on the software you use, but if you create a survey with Shout you’ll have access to these distribution methods:

* **URL**: Share a simple URL link with clients.
* **Email invitations**: Craft bespoke email invitations for your questionnaire.
* **Web embed**: Embed the questionnaire on your website.
