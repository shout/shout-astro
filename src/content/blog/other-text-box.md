Although some questions will have a straightforward set of answers, you can’t always predict every available option. This is where using an ‘Other’ text box comes in handy.

What is an ‘Other’ text box?
----------------------------

The ‘other’ text box, or comment field, allows respondents to enter a unique answer when your list doesn’t apply to them.

They will often contain the text: “Other (Please Specify)”.

### Advantages

* Save space when there are too many possible answers to include.
* Avoid creating a [bias in your survey](https://shout.com/survey-design/response-bias/) by forcing respondents to select an answer.
* Highlights responses you may not have predicted.
* Provides you with more information to discuss in your results report.

### Disadvantages

* They take more time to analyze than multiple choice answers.
* Their use can decrease the [statistical significance](https://hbr.org/2016/02/a-refresher-on-statistical-significance) of the responses.
* There’s a risk that respondents will abuse the other answer option by giving irrelevant answers.

**Note**: The answer list you provide respondents should not be any less exhaustive just because you’ve used a comment field

Test your survey on a sample audience to find out if you need to provide a comment field beneath your answers.
